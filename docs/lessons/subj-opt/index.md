#Overview

You were introduced to the indicative mood in Module 1. In this module, you will learn how to form verbs in the subjunctive and optative moods. Verbs in these moods appear frequently in subordinate clauses (such as the purpose clause, in this module) and in certain independent clauses (which you will learn about next semester).

Learning to form subjunctive and optative verbs will open up whole worlds of expression â€” possibilities, conditions, wishes, mental content of all sorts.

Important things to know:

- The way we translate subjunctives and optatives is entirely dependent on their context. You must always first identify the type of "verbal chunk" they belong to.
- Forming these verbs requires only adding a new set of endings onto the same principal part stems that you have already learned.
