# The Greek alphabet


Notes for overview:

- the form of the Greek alphabet we use evolved over many centuries
- memorize the alphabet in alphabetical order so you can use a dictionary
- practice reading aloud until you are comfortable pronouncing Greek words you have not seen before

A few details to note:

- "rough breathing" spells out when words spelled with an initial vowel start with an "h-" sound
- sigma changes form at the end of a word but is not pronounced differently
- "iota subscript" became an alternate way of spelling a final iota when the final iota began to be dropped in pronounciation. (You could think of it as similar to using an apostrophe when you write a contraction like "don't" in English, but we'll make a habit of pronouncing the iota subscript.)



Tips:

- read out loud (as the ancient Greeks did!)
- we can't precisely recover ancient pronounciation, but try to distinguish sounds that are spelled differently (e.g., ο/ω ε/η ), and include accent in your pronounciation.  Hear the difference between ἀστραπηβόλος, "one who throws lightning" (an adjective describing Zeus) and ἀστραπήβολος  "one struck by lightning".  It makes a difference!



Practice reading these words out loud:


- Ἐρατοσθένης  (name of the murdered man in Lysias, *Oration 1*)
- Εὐφίλητος (name of the man accused of murder)
- Σώστρατος (name of a friend of Εὐφίλητος)
- Ἀθηναῖοι
