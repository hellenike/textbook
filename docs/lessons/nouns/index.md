# Greek nouns 

## Overview of nouns 

Main points to cover:
All nouns have gender, case, and number.
- There are three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter.
- Cases reflect function in a sentence. Cases are determined by endings. There are five cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative. 
- Greek has three numbers: singular, plural, and dual (but we won't see the dual this year). 

## Dictionary entry of nouns 

The dictionary of a noun efficiently encodes all the information you need to know in order to produce all of its cases and numbers. The first word tells you its nominative singular form, the second word is its genitive singular form, and the third word tells you its gender(s).

## Declension 

Nouns are organized into “declensions,” a category of nouns that share the same set of endings. In Greek, there are three declensions of nouns.
