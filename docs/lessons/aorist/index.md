# The aorist indicative

## Verbs

- we'll always begin our reading with *verbal units* that express an action
- the form of a verb expresses the *subject* as well as the *verb*.  Example:  the form ἐκέλευσε means "he or she ordered"; the form ἐκέλευσαν means "they ordered".  These are complete sentences that do not need a separate word for "he", "she" or "they."

## Overview of Greek verbs

Main points to cover:


- Greek verbs can have five properties: PNTMV.  (We call verb forms with these five properties *finite* verb forms.)
- you recognize the form of a Greek form from its combination of a stem and an ending
- Greek verbs have six stems called *principal parts*
- accent of finite verb forms is *recessive*

## The *aorist indicative*

Main points: tense and mood


- the indicative mood is the mood for narrating factual events
- Greek has multiple tenses for narrating events in the past
- the *aorist* tense views an action as a single or completed action


Main points: voice

- the Greek verb has *three* voices (!!): AMP
- not all verbs appear in all three voices.  Example:  the verb γίγνομαι "to become" always uses the middle voice.
- the aorist tense forms the active and middle voices from the *third* principal part; it forms the passive voice from the *sixth* principal part


## Forming the aorist indicative

- principal parts give an example form in the first singular indicative active of a representative tense: start by dropping the first singular ending and the accent:

ἔδειξα -> ἐδειξ-
ἐκέλευσα -> ἐκελευσ-
