## Module 1 reading selection


Based on Lysias 1, sections 7-8:  the early days of Euphiletos' marriage.



ἔδοξε Εὐφιλήτῳ γῆμαι καὶ γυναῖκα ἠγάγετο εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν. παιδίον δέ ἐγένετο αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐπίστευε ἤδη καὶ πάντα ἐκείνῃ παρέδωκε. ἐν μὲν οὖν τῷ πρώτῳ χρόνῳ, πασῶν ἦν βελτίστη. ἀλλὰ ἡ Εὐφιλήτου μήτηρ  ἐτελεύτησε, καὶ πάντων τῶν κακῶν αἰτία ἐγένετο.

### Reading in context

Beyond the challenge of decphering syntax and vocabulary, practically any sentence of Greek you read will also raise questions that arise from the cultural and historical distance between us and the text.  Reading this passage thoughtfully in Greek forces us to think about the institution of marriage in the classical Greek world.

The first sentence begins with *Euphiletos* making a decision to marry; he is also the grammatical subject of ἠγάγετο.  The next sentence continues with the statement that a child was born *to him*.  Beyond the grammatical construction, who is directing and significant in this marriage?  Who is invisible?

Use your new knowledge of Greek verbs to identify the tenses of the verbs ἐπίστευε and παρέδωκε.  Why does Lysias use different tenses for these two actions?  Consider the sequence of actions here: first, παιδίον ἐγένετο, then ἐπίστευε, then παρέδωκε.  How does Lysias represent the development of Euphiletos' marriage?

In the last sentence, ἀλλὰ introduces a strong contrast.  Things were great at first, but then all of Euphiletos' troubles began.  Again, only one name is mentioned. We're in a world where women play essential roles, but are invisible.  This is Euphiletos' story, about Euphiletos' family and household.
