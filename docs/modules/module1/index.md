# Module 1: the Greek verb


## Overview of module 1

### Language: overview

Module 1 introduces these features of Greek:


- verbal units expressing a subject and action
- how to recognize finite verb forms and identify them with person, number, tense, mood, voice
- principal parts of Greek verbs
- the aorist and imperfect indicative tenses

### Ancient Greek in action: overview

Different languages imagine the world differently. To narrate past events, for example, English does not have a single verb tense that correspond to the ideas expressed by the Greek imperfect tense. Module 1 includes reflections of English speakers encountering a different imperfect tense in Spanish and Italian.

### Reading: overview

In our reading in module 1, we meet Euphiletus, the speaker in Lysias, *Oration 1*.  Euphiletus describes the early days of his marriage (to a wife who is never named).
