# Introduction to the imperfect indicative tense



- two very common tenses for narrating action in the indicative mood in past time: previously seen aorist, and imperfect
- differ in aspect: continuous, repeated, habitual or otherwise incomplete action versus single or complete action
- formation of active voice using first principal part:
    - both -ω and -μι verbs
    - 3rd singular and 3rd plural only
- formation of (morphologically ambiguous!) middle and passive voices using first principal part:
    - both -ω and -μι verbs
    - 3rd singular and 3rd plural only
