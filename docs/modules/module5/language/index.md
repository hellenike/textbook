## Subordinate clauses and the indicative, subjunctive, and optative moods 

In this module, we will learn another kind of relationship between clauses as we study structures of dependent or subordinate clauses. The verbs of these subordinate clauses may appear in the indicative and optative moods, along with a new mood we will learn: the subjunctive mood. We will start learning in this module how the subjunctive is used in some types of subordinate clauses that are introduced by subordinating conjunctions.
