## Subordinate clauses and the optative mood (ἡ εὐκτικὴ ἔγκλισις) 

In this module, we will learn another kind of relationship between clauses as we study structures of dependent or subordinate clauses. Along with that, we will introduce another mood of ancient Greek verbs, the optative mood. The optative mood has many uses, and we will start learning in this module how it is used in some types of subordinate clauses that are introduced by subordinating conjunctions.
