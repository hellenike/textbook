# Module 3:  participles


Practice, reading and composition based on Lysias 1, sections 16-19:  an elderly woman reveals to Euphiletos that his wife is having an affair with Eratosthenes.


## Overview of module 3

### Language


Module 3 introduces these features of Greek:

- the **participle** is a verbal unit that expresses a subordinate verbal idea, similar to a  subordinate clause in English.
- the aorist and present tenses of the participle view verbal actions similarly to the finite forms of the aorist and imperfect tenses
- participles in the **attributive position** describe a substantive, similar to an English relative clause
- a few verbs like ἄρχω and τυγχάνω take a **supplementary participle** to complete the sense of the verb
- the subordinate verbal idea of **circumstantial participle** can express a wide range of attendant circumstances (time, causation, condition, concession...)  using a noun or pronoun in the clause as its subject
- you can add an additional noun plus circumstantial participle to a clause by putting the noun in the genitive case (the "**genitive absolute**")
