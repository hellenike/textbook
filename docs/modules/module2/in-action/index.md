## Ancient Greek in action: gender identity and language

As you've seen in this module, we group ancient Greek nouns, adjectives and pronouns in categories called "gender."  What does it mean to say the δῶρον is neuter, γνώμη feminine or λόγος  masculine?

Classics scholar and teacher Tom Hendrickson looks at grammatical gender in Greek and Latin (which we also analyze as having the three genders masculine, feminine and neuter).
