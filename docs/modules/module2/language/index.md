## Nouns (τὸ ὄνομἀ) and adjectives (τὸ ἐπίθετον)


In this module, we'll learn about two further parts of speech: nouns (ancient Greek ὀνόματα, the *names* for people and things), and adjectives, words that describe nouns (Greek ἐπίθετα, literally "add ons").

Unlike English, where word order determines the role of a noun, Greek shows the function of nouns and adjective through changes in their form.
