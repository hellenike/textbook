# Module 4:  subordination


## Overview of module 4

### Language

Main areas of focus are:
- first subordinate clause (introducing subordinating conjunctions, use of μή)
- sequence of tenses
- morphology of subjunctive and optative moods, all three voices, 3S and Pl (aorist, imperfect tenses)

### Making Connections 

- Phuc Tran on the power of a non-indicative mood

### Practice, Reading, and Composition

- Continuing with Lysias 1, sections 20-22(?)
- Can express purpose in two different ways
