# Module 4:  indirect speech


## Overview of module 4

Practice, reading and composition are based on Lysias 1, sections 19-20: Euphiletos confronts the slave girl with his discovery that she has been cooperating with Eratosthenes.

### Language

Module 4 introduces these features of Greek:

- **indirect speech** refers to speech that reports what another speaker says. Greek uses three different constructions to express indirect speech:
    - after a verb indicating speaking or thinking, Greek can use a new form, the **infinitive**, with its subject in the accusative case
    - after a verb indicating perception or knowing, Greek can use a participle
    - Greek can introduce a subordinate clause with the conjunction ὡς or ὅτι. When the main verb is in a past tense (aorist or imperfect), the verb of the subordinate clause can appear in a new mood, the **optative**
 

### Practice, Reading, and Composition

Reading selection based on Lysias 1.19–20.
