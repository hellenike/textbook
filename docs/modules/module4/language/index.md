# Module 4: Subordination

In this module, we will introduce the first of several types of subordinate clauses you will learn in Greek: the purpose clause. 

You will see that the purpose clause (a subordinate clause, introduced by a subordinating conjunction with a verb in the subjunctive or optative) is an alternative method of expressing the idea of purpose through a future tense participle. Options!
