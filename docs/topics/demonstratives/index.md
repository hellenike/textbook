## Demonstrative adjectives and pronouns
IN NOM/GEN


The label "demonstrative" signifies that these words "point" to their referent. They may act as adjectives, modifying an expressed noun, or they may be used on their own, acting as a pronoun. English has two commonly used demonstratives: "this" and "that," which can also be used as adjectives modifying a noun (this woman, that house) or on their own as pronouns. Ancient Greek has three demonstrative adjectives/pronouns, and it is important to understand the conceptual meaning of each one.

**ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε** ("this") is used to point to something present and visible or immediate, similar to colloquial English using "this here" to describe someone or something. Conceptually it is a "first person" demonstrative, meaning that the speaker is involved with what is being pointed at. Within a text or narrative, ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε points _forward_ to what comes next, making it similar in such a context to a phrase like "the following" in English.

**οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο** ("this" or "that") is conceptually between the closeness of ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε and the distance of ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο and is "second person" (closer to the addressee than the speaker). In contrast to ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε in narrative or text, οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο looks _back_ and so points to "the preceding." It points to something closer in text than ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο, and so means "the latter" in contrast to "the former" (for which ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο would be used).

**ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο** ("that") is conceptually pointing further away than the other two demonstratives, as in a "third person" idea. The use of ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο may have an intentionally distancing effect, as "that" can in English ("I would never do _that_!")

When functioning as adjectives, demonstratives are used in ancient Greek along with the article and in predicate position. Examples:
- ἥδε ἡ ἡμέρα  "this day" (meaning "this very day, this day now, today")
- τούτον τὸν ἄνδρα "this/that man"
- τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἐκείνοις "to/for those people"

(Since English does not use its article along with demonstratives, we do not translate the article in these constructions. Leaving the article out of the translation is necessary to be idiomatic in English. That is another example of how translation is not a "one-to-one" substitution of words.)

When used as pronouns, the demonstratives are used on their own. They receive their gender and case from their _antecedent_, the noun they refer back to, but the case expresses the use of the pronoun in its own clause. If the antecedent is implied or understood, rather than expressed, we understand a noun that matches the gender and number of the demonstrative pronoun: ἐκεῖνος "that man" (masculine and singular), ταῦτα "these things" (neuter and plural), τῆσδε "of this (here) woman" (feminine and singular).
