## Demonstrative adjectives and pronouns

A special group of adjectives are called the **demonstrative adjectives** because the "point to" a noun.  They are frequently used on their own, as a kind of **pronoun**, standing in for a noun. 

English has two commonly used demonstratives: "this" and "that," which can also be used as adjectives modifying a noun ("this woman," "that house") or on their own as pronouns ("these", "those"). Ancient Greek has *three*  very commonly used demonstrative adjectives/pronouns.  It is important to understand the conceptual meaning of each pronoun.  They also have somewhat irregular forms, and are constructed differently from other adjectives. 


As with other adjectives, they will be listed in lexica with the masculine, feminine and neuter of the nominative singular.

### ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε

**ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε** is points to something present and visible or immediate. It can often be translated with "this," and is similar to the colloquial English phrase "this here" to describe someone or something. 

Conceptually, the speaker is always present or involved with what is being pointed at. Within a text or narrative, ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε points *forward* to what comes *next*, similar in such a context to a phrase like "the following" in English.




### οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο
**οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο** ("this" or "that") is conceptually between the closeness of ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε and the distance of ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο and is "second person" (closer to the addressee than the speaker). In contrast to ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε in narrative or text, οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο looks _back_ and so points to "the preceding." It points to something closer in text than ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο, and so means "the latter" in contrast to "the former" (for which ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο would be used).

**ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο** ("that") is conceptually pointing further away than the other two demonstratives, as in a "third person" idea. The use of ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο may have an intentionally distancing effect, as "that" can in English ("I would never do _that_!")

When functioning as adjectives, demonstratives are used in ancient Greek along with the article and in predicate position. Examples:
- ἥδε ἡ ἡμέρα  "this day" (meaning "this very day, this day now, today")
- οὗτος ὁf ἄνθρωπος  "this/that person"
- τὰ παιδία ἐκείνα "to/for those people"


(Since English does not use its article along with demonstratives, we do not translate the article in these constructions. Leaving the article out of the translation is necessary to be idiomatic in English. That is another example of how translation is not a "one-to-one" substitution of words.)

When used as pronouns, the demonstratives are used on their own. They receive their gender and case from their **antecedent**, the noun they refer back to, but the case expresses the use of the pronoun in its own clause. If the antecedent is implied or understood, rather than expressed, we understand a noun that matches the gender and number of the demonstrative pronoun: ἐκεῖνος "that man" (masculine and singular), ταῦτα "these things" (neuter and plural), τῆσδε "of this (here) woman" (feminine and singular).
