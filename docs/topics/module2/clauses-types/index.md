## Types of clauses


Recall that every instance of a finite verb identifies a clause.  When we have chunked together the words in a clause, the case of nouns will tell us how they function in the clause (subject, direct or indirect object, etc.). Looking at the verb of a clause together with the main nouns (if any), we can think about the verbal action in the clause in one of three categories: **transitive**, **intransitive** or **linking**.

### Transitive verb clauses

A transitive verb is one that can take a direct object if the verb is in the active or middle voice. The transitive verb can have a passive form. In the passive, the agent can be expressed with ὑπό + genitive.

ἡ ἐμὴ γυνὴ ὑπὸ τούτου τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ὤφθη (ὀφθεῖσα in text)

( == ὁ ἄνθρωπος τὴν ἐμὴν γυναῖκα εἶδε.)


### Intransitive verb clauses

The clause is formed with an intransitive verb.  An intransitive verb does not take a direct object, so we will not expect to see one in this type of clause.

ἧκον ἀπροσδοκήτως ἐξ ἀγροῦ



### Linking verb clauses

The clause contains a linking verb, whether expressed or implied. A linking clause joins together a nominative subject and a nominative predicate with a verb referring to a state of being (εἰμί). Note that in ancient Greek, when the linking verb is in the third person, εἰμί can be omitted and understood from context.

οἰκονόμος δεινὴ καὶ φειδωλὸς ἀγαθὴ {ἤν}
