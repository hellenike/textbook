## Adjectives: full declensions

The following tables illustrate full declensions of adjectives.  Notice that you already know the new dative and accusative endings from the noun forms you have learned.



### First- and second-declension (or 2-1-2) adjectives

|  Case  | Masculine singular| Feminine singular | Neuter singular| Masculine plural| Feminine plural | Neuter plural|     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative | ἀγαθός | ἀγαθή | ἀγαθόν | ἀγαθοί  | ἀγαθαί  | ἀγαθά  |
| Genitive | ἀγαθοῦ  | ἀγαθῆς  | ἀγαθοῦ | ἀγαθῶν  | ἀγαθῶν | ἀγαθῶν |
| Dative | ἀγαθῷ  | ἀγαθῇ | ἀγαθῷ | ἀγαθοῖς | ἀγαθαῖς  | ἀγαθοῖς |
| Accusative | ἀγαθόν | ἀγαθήν | ἀγαθόν | ἀγαθούς  | ἀγαθάς  | ἀγαθά  |





### First- and third-declension (or 3-1-3) adjectives

Other adjectives are called "first and third declension" adjectives because the feminine forms belong to the first declension while the masculine and neuter belong to the third declension. As we have already seen with verb principal parts, the more common an adjective is, the more likely it is to be "irregular" in its forms. The most common irregular adjective in our readings this year will be the adjective πᾶς, πᾶσα, πᾶν, and its compound form ἅπας, ἅπασα, ἅπαν. The English equivalents, depending on the particular use in context, include "all," "every" and "whole." That is, both adjectives indicate a completeness or entirety, and ἅπας, ἅπασα, ἅπαν emphasizes that quality even more. They decline the same way, although note the difference in persistent accent between the two.

**Declension of πᾶς, πᾶσα, πᾶν**


|  Case  | Masculine singular| Feminine singular | Neuter singular| Masculine plural| Feminine plural | Neuter plural|     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative | πᾶς  | πᾶσα  | πᾶν | πάντες  | πᾶσαι   | πάντα   |
| Genitive | παντός  | πάσης   | παντός  | πάντων   | πασῶν  | πάντων  |
| Dative | παντί  | πάσῃ | παντί | πᾶσι or πᾶσιν | πάσαις  | πᾶσι or πᾶσιν |
| Accusative | πάντα | πᾶσαν | πᾶν  | πάντας   | πάσας   | πάντα   |


We will see further examples of the 3-1-3 declension pattern in the next module when we learn about participles, a kind of adjective made from verb stems.
