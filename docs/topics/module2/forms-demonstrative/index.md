The 


#### Declensions of demonstrative pronouns

**Declension of ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε**

| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| Nominative | ὅδε | ἥδε | τόδε | οἵδε | αἵδε | τάδε |
| Genitive | τοῦδε | τῆσδε | τοῦδε | τῶνδε | τῶνδε | τῶνδε |
| Dative | τῷδε | τῇδε | τῷδε | τοῖσδε | ταῖσδε | τοῖσδε |
| Accusative | τόνδε | τήνδε | τόδε | τούσδε | τάσδε | τάδε |


**Declension of οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο**

| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| Nominative | οὗτος | αὕτη | τοῦτο | οὗτοι | αὗται | ταῦτα |
| Genitive | τούτου | ταύτης | τούτου | τούτων | τούτων | τούτων |
| Dative | τούτῳ | ταύτῃ | τούτῳ | τούτοῖς | ταύταις | τούτοις |
| Accusative | τούτον | ταύτην | τοῦτο | τούτους | ταύτας | ταῦτα |

> Notes on the forms of οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο:
- The stem follows a pattern similar to the article, with the stem starting in tau in most forms, but with a rough breathing instead in the masculine and feminine nominative forms, both singular and plural.
- The masculine and neuter forms have second declension endings with the diphthong **ου** in the stem, while the feminine forms have first decelension endings with the diphthong **αυ** in the stem.
- The exception in the feminine is the genitive plural, which is assimilated to the same form as the masculine and neuter genitvie plural, τούτων.
- The neuter nominative and accustive plural forms use the αυ diphthong in phonetic assimilation with its ending -α.
- The neuter singular nominative and accusative are a different kind of second declension ending (-ο instead of -ον).
- The persistent accent pattern is the accent on a long penult. Thus the accent does not move from the penult, and will be a circumflex when the ultima is short and an acute when the ultima is long.
