## Forms of the dative and accusative cases

The following tables summarize the endings for the three Greek noun declensions for the dative and accusative cases, with an example noun illustrating each pattern in nominative, genitive, dative and accusative.

The case endings you are learning for dative and accusative cases will show up again in many other forms, including the adjectives we will study in this module.  Taking the time to memorize them thoroughly will pay off repeatedly.

Look for patterns in these endings that can help you recognize the case endings:

- Note that for a neuter noun or adjective in any declension, the accusative singular form will always be the same as the nominative singular form, and the accusative plural forms will always be the same as the nominative plural form.
- Note that the dative plural ending of third declension nouns will have a "moveable nu" placed on the ending if the next word in the sentence starts with a vowel or if it is the last word in a sentence. In paradigms, therefore, you will see both options, without and with the nu on the end.

### Third declension

As with the nominative and genitive cases, the underlying consonant stems of third-declension nouns can sometimes result in slight variations in the combined stem + ending.  Notice for example for the noun μάρτυς that in the dative plural, the final rho of the stem has elided with the initial sigma of the ending.
