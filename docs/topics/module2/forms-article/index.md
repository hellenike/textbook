## The article: complete declension

The table below lists all forms of the article. Note that almost all the new dative and accusative forms look like regular first and second declension endings applied to a stem of τ-.  The only exception is the neuter accusative singular τό -- which, like all neuter accusatives, is identical to the neuter nominative form of the same number.
