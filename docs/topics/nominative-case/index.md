## The nominative case  



The **nominative case** is a naming case. Its most frequent function is to indicate the subject of a finite verb. **Subject-verb agreement** means that the person and number of the subject must be the same as the person and number of the verb. So a *singular* noun in the nominative will have a third person *singular* verb form. In most cases, a nominative *plural* noun acting as the subject will  agree with a third person *plural* verb. Note, however, that in ancient Greek, *neuter* nominative *plural* nouns acting as the subject often take a third person *singular* verb form.

Consider these examples:

> ἡ μήτηρ ἐτελεύτησε, "His mother died."

ἡ μήτηρ is nominative, singular, and feminine, "his mother".  ἐτελεύτησε, "she died," is from τελευτάω, τελευτήσω, ἐτελεύτησα, τετελεύτηκα, τετελεύτημαι, ἐτελευτήθην, "to die." It is aorist, active and indicative; since it is in the third person singular, it *agrees* with the subject ἡ μήτηρ.


> τὸ παιδίον ἐβόα, "The baby was crying."

τὸ παιδίον, "the baby" is neuter nominative singular. ἐβόα, "It was crying," is from βοάω, βοήσω, ἐβόησα, βεβόηκα, βεβόημαι, ἐβοήθην, "to shout, cry," and is in the imperfect indicative active.  Because it is third person singular, it agrees with the subject τὸ παιδίον.

> ἐψόφουν αἱ θύραι, "The doors began to creak."

αἱ θύραι, "the doors," is feminine nominative *plural*. (We'll see the plural forms of the article and noun in this module.) ψοφέω "to make a noise" is a regular epsilon contract verb, so this form is the imperfect indicative active.  Since it is in the third person plural, it agrees with the subject αἱ θύραι.  (Note that subjects can follow the verb in Greek: its stil clear from its nominative case form that it functions as the subject of ἐψόφουν.)

> ταῦτα δίκαια ἦν, "These things were right."

ταῦτα is the neuter nominative plural of a pronoun we'll learn in this module ("this, these").  You've already learned that ἦν is an imperfect indicative active form of "to be."  It is third person singular:  since ταῦτα is *neuter* plural, the singular verb agrees with the plural subject. (δίκαια is an adjective we'll learn in this module, meaning "just, right.")
