## Adverbs

Words that modify or describe the action of a verb are called **adverbs**.  Adverbs typically express ideas like *manner* ("she read the text *quickly*), *time* ("*afterwards*, he took a nap"), or *place* ("they live *nearby*"). Adverbs can clarify and make vivid the meaning of a verb that might otherwise be bland.   They can even completely change the sense of a clause  Changing "Documents were destroyed" to "Documents were deliberately destroyed" could be the difference between an accident and a crime. Adding the English adverb *not* to a sentence negates its meaning entirely!

Here are a few examples of adverbs you will see in Lysias 1.  Think about how they affect the meaning of a simple sentence.

### Manner

The defendant, Euphiletos, addresses the jury: "You know this"; but he adds the adverb εὖ "well".  How different is "You know this perfectly well"?

### Time

The common adverb ἔπειτα "next, then" sets the sequence of events in a narrative. Euphiletos hears from a household servant how Eratosthenes approached her: "She told me *first*, how he approached her, and how *then* (ἔπειτα) she became the messenger from Eratosthenes to my (Euphiletos') wife."  What difference does it make to specify that these two events happened successively?

Another common adverb expressing time is νῦν "now, at the present moment."  Euphiletos pointedly  uses νῦν in his closing summary to the jury: "I am *now* (νῦν) at risk of my life because I obeyed the law."  The jury is about to vote on their decision, so νῦν succinctly but powerfully connects his risk to their decision. (Aren't adverbs like "pointedly", "succinctly" and "powerfully" helpful in talking about this?)


### Place

In Euphiletos' dramatic narrative of how Eratosthenes was caught in Euphiletos' house, the precise location of events is crucial.  Euphiletos describes the arrangements in his house, where the women normally lived ἄνω "above" (that is, "upstairs") and Euphiletos lived κάτω "downstairs".  Once the baby was born, they changed the arrangements so his wife would not have to go down the stairs at night to wash up after caring for the baby.  That makes it possible for Eratosthenes to sneak in to see Euphiletos' wife.  When Euphiletos finds out that Eratosthenes is  ἔνδον ("inside, indoors," so "in the house"), he looks to his neighbors for help, and finds some of them at home (again, ἔνδον, "in their houses").




### Negation with finite verb forms

English negates a finite verb with the word *not*. Ancient Greek has two main words to negate a finite verb form: οὐ and μή. 

- οὐ: Indicative verbs in most clauses are negated with οὐ. Note that οὐ has a smooth breathing and no accent. If the word that follows οὐ in a sentence begins with a vowel also with a smooth breathing, οὐ becomes οὐκ. If the word following begins with a rough breathing, οὐ becomes οὐχ. 
- μή: Some verbs in other moods or in certain types of clauses use μή instead. We will meet μή again in Module 4.
