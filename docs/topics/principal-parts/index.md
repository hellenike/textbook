## Principal parts of verbs

All verb forms in these many combinations of person, number, tense, mood and voice, as well as infinitives and participles, are formed using the verb's principal parts. 

English verbs have principal parts, too, although native speakers may not learn them as such. In English, the principal parts can include the present, past, and past participle: for example, play, played, played; swim, swam, swum; go, went, gone; do, did, done. 

The standard number of principal parts for Ancient Greek verbs is six, although for some verbs fewer principal parts, even only one or two, may exist; and for others, alternatives may exist and increase the total number. 

Learning the principal parts of verbs is important so that you will be able to create correct verb forms and so that you will be able to recognize verb forms in a text, both for what person, number, tense, voice, and mood they are and also what verb they come from. In a glossary or a lexicon Greek verbs are listed according to the first principal part, and so if you are looking a verb up you will need to be able to move from a verb form made from any principal part to its first principal part in order to find it in the lexicon.

### Forms of Prinicipal Parts
All principal parts of an Ancient Greek verb are 1st person singular forms.

Principal part	Form
1st		1st person singular present active indicative OR 
		1st person singular present middle indicative if active forms do not exist

2nd		1st person singular future active indicative OR
		1st person singular future middle indicative if active forms do not exist

3rd		1st person singular aorist active indicative OR
		1st person singular aorist middle indicative if active forms do not exist

4th		1st person singular perfect active indicative 

5th		1st person singular perfect middle/passive indicative

6th		1st person singular aorist passive indicative


### Examples of principal parts of commonly used verbs in Lysias 1.

### Looking for patterns

As you learn principal parts, you should practice noticing patterns and then using those patterns to help you recognize, retrieve, use, and even take an educated guess at, a principal part. Here are some general patterns to start noticing, but you should work at discovering others that help you memorize, recall, and work with principal parts.


#### Endings: 
Since all the forms are first-person singular, the ending reflects that person-number. 

For those parts that could be either active or middle, the ending will also indicate the voice: -ω or -μι (1st and 2nd principal parts), and -ον or -α (3rd) are active, while -μαι (1st and 2nd) and -μην (3rd) are middle. 

For the 4th principal part, which is always active, you can expect the ending -α. 
For the 5th, which is always middle/passive, the endings is -μαι. 
And the 6th principal part, which is always passive, will end in -ην.  

#### Prefixes:
For the 3rd and 6th principal parts, which are aorist (a secondary tense) you will see an augment as a prefix to the verbal stem. The augment is the indication of a secondary tense in the indicative mood (all principal parts are in the indicative mood). The augment may appear as the addition of an ἐ- before a stem that begins with a consonant, or it may appear as the lengthening of the initial vowel if the stem begins with a vowel.

For the 4th and 5th principal parts, which are in the perfect tense, the stem will show reduplication as a sign of the perfect tense. The reduplication may appear as a repetition of the initial consonant of the verb stem. If the initial consonant is aspirated (θ, φ, χ), the reduplication is the corresponding non-aspirated consonant (τ, π, κ, respectively). If the stem starts with multiple consonants, the reduplication will be simply ἐ-. If the stem starts with a vowel, the reduplication will appear as a lengthened vowel.

#### Stem changes:
As in English, very common verbs show greater changes to the verb stem in different principal parts. Compare ἔρχομαι (present) and ἦλθον (aorist) with "go" (present) and "went" (past) in English.

Some changes to verb stems appear with many more regular verbs: 
A sigma may be added to the present stem for the future and/or aorist active stem (2nd and 3rd principal parts, e.g., κελεύω, κελεύσω, ἐκέλευσα), 
A kappa may be part of the stem in the perfect active (4th principal part, e.g., κεκέλευκα). 
The 6th principal part may have a theta at the end of its stem, e.g. ἐδυνήθην.
