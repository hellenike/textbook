## Indirect Statement and Indirect Question Using the Optative

Here we add two more types of subordinate clauses that can use the optative. In future modules we will learn other ways that anicent Greek can structure this type of expression, and we limit our focus here to these types of subordinate clauses.

The term **indirect** in **indirect statement** and **indirect question** indicates that that the statement or question is being reported as having been said or asked (or thought or any other way in which speech is used by human beings). So instead of a direct statement ("She left the house.") or a direct question ("Why did she leave the house?"), indirect statement reports that the statement was made: "She said that she left the house," and indirect question reports that a question was asked: "He asked why she left the house." Indirect questions can also follow verbs of speech that are not directly about the asking: "He knew why she left the house."

In those examples, we can see that in English indirect statement and indirect question are also structured as subordinate clauses governed by a verb related to speech (say, tell, ask, think, believe, etc.)

### Indirect Statement Using the Optative

One way that ancient Greek expresses indirect statement has the following structure:
- a subordinate clause beginning with the conjunction ὅτι or ὡς 
- the clause uses a finite verb that retains the tense and voice of the direct statement. If the verb governing the subordinate clause of indirect statement is in a secondary (past) tense, then the mood of finite verb in the subordinate clause may be changed to the optative of the same tense and voice.
