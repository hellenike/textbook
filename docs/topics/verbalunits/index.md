## Verbal units

When people listen to their native language, we don't simply hear a stream of sound: we intuitively cluster meaningful units together.  When we learn to read, we similarly learn how to recognize clusters of letters and words, to "chunk" the text into meaningful units.

As you learn how to read ancient Greek, we will emphasize this crucial skill.  Rather than simply analyzing one word at a time reading left to right, you will learn how to see sentences and whole paragraphs as compositions of smaller pieces, each with a recognizable structure and meaning.

We will use the term *verbal unit* to refer to the most important underlying structure in Greek. A *verb* is a word that expresses an action or a state of being. (As [Schoolhouse Rock put it decades ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrfZCvTe-Ko), "Verb: that's what happening.")  A verbal unit combines some form of a verb with a subject to express a complete idea.

Compared to English, Greek has an extremely rich system of verb forms that can form different kinds of verbal units.  In module 3, for example, we will learn about how Greek can form verbal units using participles quite differently from anything in English.

The most important verbal unit in Greek, however, is the *finite verb*.  Every sentence has at least one verbal unit expressed with a finite verb and a subject, even if these are only implied.  In English, if someone asks you "Coffee or tea?" they are implying "Would you like coffee or tea?", a sentence with a subject ("you") and verb ("would like").    


ῥῆμα is statement.




### Clauses and coordination


- A verbal unit containing a *finite* verb form is called a *clause*. A sentence consists of one or more clauses.
- Greek *coordinates* successive clauses with *conjunctions* or *particles*. Ancient Greek has an affinity for connecting clauses and sentences to show their relationship to one another. In many styles of English, starting every sentence by connecting it to the previous one could quickly seem excessive, but doing so is more the norm in many styles of Anicent Greek prose and even poetry.




- conjunctions: will look in unit 3 at *subordinating* conjunctions; for now, *coordinating* conjunctions. Join parallel clauses (that is, a verbal unit expressed by a finite verb).



> ἔδοξέ μοι γῆμαι **καὶ** γυναῖκα ἠγαγόμην εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν.
>
> I decided to marry, and took a wife.


- particles. Rich, varied, characteristic of Greek.  Many function like coordinating conjunctions to join parallel clauses, but are placed *after* the first word of the unit they introduce (while conjunctions are the first word of the clause).


ἐγὼ **μὲν** ἐγέλων

ἐκείνη **δὲ** ... προστίθησι τὴν θύραν  

**καὶ** τὴν κλεῖν ἐφέλκεται

The first component is ἐγὼ ἐγέλων, "I started to laugh".  The second component starts ἐκείνη προστίθησι τὴν θύραν, "She locks the door" and is continued with τὴν κλεῖν ἐφέλκεται "She takes the key." **μὲν**  and **δὲ** balance what the speaker, Euphiletus, does, and what his (unnamed) wife does.  **καὶ** always joins together things of the same type; here, it's connecting the two things Euphiletus' wife does ("She locks the door and takes the key").  You might express that in English with something like "I started to laugh, but she locks the door and takes the key." The verb ἐγέλων is in a tense we'll study in this unit called the imperfect tense.  It indicates that an action is in some sense not complete, so one possibility is to take that as "I started to laugh." The speaker uses the present tense for the wife's actions, but as we might in English switch into the present tense in narrating past events, to emphasize a vivid moment: "I laughed, and BOOM! she locks the door!"  One possibility for putting together **μὲν**  and **δὲ** here could be, "I started to laugh, then she locks the door and takes the key".

### Vocabulary to memorize

These conjunctions *introduce* a clause:

- ἀλλά.  Strong contrast with previous clause. ("but")
- καί. Couples following clause with previous clauses. ("and")

These particles are the *second* element of the new clause. One way to describe this placement in their clause is "postpositive" (meaning something like "placed after")

- γάρ. This clause explains the previous clause.
- οὖν. This clause draws a conclusion from the prevoius clause.
- τε.  Couples this clause with the previous clause (similar to καί).
- μέν ... δέ The use of these particles together show a contrast of some sort along with a connection. A series of two or more clauses can be joined into a *list* using the particles μέν…δέ…<δέ…>; δέ can be repeated to join as many clauses as you like into a single list.
