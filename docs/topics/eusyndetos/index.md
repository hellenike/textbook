## Types of clauses

Recall that every instance of a finite verb identifies a clause.  When we have chunked together the words in a clause, the case of nouns will tell us how they function in the clause (subject, direct or indirect object, etc.). Looking at the verb of a clause together with the main nouns (if any), we can think about clauses in one of three categories, according to the type of verb that defines it: *transitive*, *intransitive* or *linking*.

### Transitive verb clauses

The clause is formed with a transitive verb. The clause may contain a direct object if the verb is in the active or middle voice. The transitive verb can have a passive form. In the passive, the agent can be expressed with ὑπό + genitive.

ἡ ἐμὴ γυνὴ ὑπὸ τούτου τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ὤφθη (ὀφθεῖσα in text)

( == ὁ ἄνθρωπος τὴν ἐμὴν γυναῖκα εἶδε.)


### Intransitive verb clauses

The clause is formed with an intransitive verb.  An intransitive verb does not take a direct object, so we will not expect to see one in this type of clause.

ἧκον ἀπροσδοκήτως ἐξ ἀγροῦ



### Linking verb clauses

The clause contains a linking verb, whether expressed or implied. A linking clause joins together a nominative subject and a nominative predicate with a verb referring to a state of being (εἰμί). Note that in ancient Greek, when the linking verb is in the third person, εἰμί can be omitted and understood from context.

οἰκονόμος δεινὴ καὶ φειδωλὸς ἀγαθὴ {ἤν}



#### Practice with coordinating clauses

Find the subject (explicit or implicit) and verb of each clause. Categorize each as transitive, intransitive, or linking.

ἧκον **μὲν** ἀπροσδοκήτως ἐξ ἀγροῦ, 

μετὰ **δὲ** τὸ δεῖπνον τὸ παιδίον ἐβόα 

**καὶ** ἐδυσκόλαινεν ... 

ὁ **γὰρ** ἄνθρωπος ἔνδον ἦν:


### Independent and dependent clauses

Another possible way of structuring sentences involves making one clause (or multiple clauses) *dependent* on another clause. 

We recognize a clause as "independent" if it can stand on its own as a sentence, even if it is connected by coordination with other independent clauses, as in the previous section. 

A dependent clause further explains or defines the independent clause that it is attached to. It is recognized by the fact that as it is structured in this sentence, it cannot stand on its own because it does not express a complete thought. As it is structured with the independent, or "main," clause, the dependent clause does have defined boundaries, so that it is clear which words belong to which clause. Recognizing those boundaries is important to correctly reading and understanding a sentence with multiple clauses.

One common type of dependent clause is structured by a relative adverb or a relative pronoun. The word "relative" indicates that the word establishes and shows a relationship between the action expressed in the dependent clause and that expressed in the independent clause.

Relative adverbs, such as "when, after, since, because" in English, show and define a temporal or causal relationship between the action of the relative adverbial (dependent) clause and the action of the main clause. 
- "When our child was born, I was already trusting my wife."
- "After my mother died, all my problems started."

Relative pronouns, "who, which, that," are used to create a clause that further describes or defines a noun in the main clause. In the next section, we will introduce the relative pronoun in ancient Greek and learn in more detail how they form relative clauses.
