## Clauses and coordination


- A verbal unit containing a *finite* verb form is called a *clause*. A sentence consists of one or more clauses.
- Greek *coordinates* successive clauses with *conjunctions* or *particles*. Ancient Greek has an affinity for connecting clauses and sentences to show their relationship to one another. In many styles of English, starting every sentence by connecting it to the previous one could quickly seem excessive, but doing so is more the norm in many styles of Anicent Greek prose and even poetry.





### Vocabulary to memorize

These conjunctions *introduce* a clause:

- ἀλλά.  Strong contrast with previous clause. ("but")
- καί. Couples following clause with previous clauses. ("and")

These particles are the *second* element of the new clause. One way to describe this placement in their clause is "postpositive" (meaning something like "placed after")

- γάρ. This clause explains the previous clause.
- οὖν. This clause draws a conclusion from the prevoius clause.
- τε.  Couples this clause with the previous clause (similar to καί).
- μέν ... δέ The use of these particles together show a contrast of some sort along with a connection. A series of two or more clauses can be joined into a *list* using the particles μέν…δέ…<δέ…>; δέ can be repeated to join as many clauses as you like into a single list.
