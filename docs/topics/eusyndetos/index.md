## Clauses and coordination


- verbal units with *finite* verb forms are called *clauses*
- Greek *coordinates* successive clauses with *conjunctions* or *particles*





### Vocabulary for today

These conjunctions *introduce* a clause:

- ἀλλά.  Strong contrast with previous clause. ("but")
- καί. Couples following clause with previous clauses. ("and")

These particles are the *second* element of the new clause:


- γάρ. This clause explains the previous clause
- οὖν. This clause draws a conclusion from the prevoius clause.
- τε.  Couples this clause with the previous clause (similar to καί).

A series of two or more clauses can be joined into a *list* using the particles μέν…δέ…<δέ…>; δέ can be repeated to join as meany clauses as you like into a single list.
