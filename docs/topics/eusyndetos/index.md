## Types of clauses

Recall that every instance of a finite verb identifies a clause.  When we have chunked together the words in a clause, the case of nouns will tell us how they function in the clause (subject, direct or indirect object). Looking at the verb of a clause together with the main nouns (if any), we can think about clauses in one of three categories, according to the type of verb that defines it: *transitive*, *intransitive* or *linking*

### Transitive verb clauses

The clause is formed with a transitive verb. The clause may contain a direct object if the verb is in the active or middle voice. The transitive verb can have a passive form. In passive, agent can be expressed with ὑπό + genitive.

ἡ ἐμὴ γυνὴ ὑπὸ τούτου τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ὤφθη (ὀφθεῖσα in text)

( == ὁ ἄνθρωπος τὴν ἐμὴν γυναῖκα εἶδε.)


### Intransitive verb clauses

The clause is formed with an intransitive verb.  An intransitive verb does not take a direct object, so we will not expect to see one in this type of clause.

ἧκον ἀπροσδοκήτως ἐξ ἀγροῦ

(perhaps examples with γίγνομαι)


### Linking verb clauses

The clause contains a linking verb, whether expressed or implied. A linking clause joins together a nominative subject and a nominative predicate with a verb referring to a state (εἰμί). Note that in ancient Greek, when the linking verb is in the third person, εἰμί can be omitted and understood from context.

οἰκονόμος δεινὴ καὶ φειδωλὸς ἀγαθὴ {ἤν}



## Examples of coordinating clauses

Find subject (explicit or implicit) and verb of each clause.  Categorize each as transitive, intransitive or linking.

ἧκον **μὲν** ἀπροσδοκήτως ἐξ ἀγροῦ, 

μετὰ **δὲ** τὸ δεῖπνον τὸ παιδίον ἐβόα 

**καὶ** ἐδυσκόλαινεν ... 

ὁ **γὰρ** ἄνθρωπος ἔνδον ἦν:
