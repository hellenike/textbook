## Types of clauses

Recall that every instance of a finite verb identifies a clause.  When we have chunked together the words in a clause, the case of nouns will tell us how they function in the clause (subject, direct or indirect object). Looking at the verb of a clause together with the main nouns (if any), we can think about clauses in one of three categories: *transitive*, *intransitive* or *linking*

### Transitive clauses

- transitive. Can have a direct object in active or middle voice; can have a passive form.  In passive, agent can be expressed with ὑπό + genitive.

ἡ ἐμὴ γυνὴ ὑπὸ τούτου τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ὤφθη (ὀφθεῖσα in text)

( == ὁ ἄνθρωπος τὴν ἐμὴν γυναῖκα εἶδε.)


### Intransitive clauses

- intransitive.  Does not take a direct object.

ἧκον ἀπροσδοκήτως ἐξ ἀγροῦ

(perhaps examples with γίγνομαι)


### Linking clauses

- linking.  Joins together a nominative subject and a nominative predicate with a verb referring to a state (εἰμί).  Note that in the third person, εἰμί can be omitted.

οἰκονόμος δεινὴ καὶ φειδωλὸς ἀγαθὴ {ἤν}



## Examples of coordinating clauses

Find subject (explicit or implicit) and verb of each clause.  Categorize each as transitive, intransitive or linking.

ἧκον **μὲν** ἀπροσδοκήτως ἐξ ἀγροῦ, 

μετὰ **δὲ** τὸ δεῖπνον τὸ παιδίον ἐβόα 

**καὶ** ἐδυσκόλαινεν ... 

ὁ **γὰρ** ἄνθρωπος ἔνδον ἦν:
