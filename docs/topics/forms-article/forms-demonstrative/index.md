### Full declension of demonstrative pronouns

Pronouns (ἡ ἀντωνυμία)

"Pronoun" is a part of speech. Pronouns are used in place of and in reference to a noun: the Greek name ἀντωνυμία means "in place of a noun." The noun that a pronoun replaces and refers to is called the pronoun's _antecedent_.

Like nouns, pronouns in ancient Greek have grammatical gender, case, and number. The case of a pronoun, like that of a noun, will tell you its function in a clause.

There are several types of pronouns in ancient Greek, as there are in English: personal, demonstrative, relative, interrogative, indefinite, reflexive, and reciprocal. We know and use all of these types of pronouns without perhaps knowing their classification. In this section, we will learn the ancient Greek personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, and the relative pronoun.




#### Declensions of demonstrative pronouns

**Declension of ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε**

| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem | Neut | Masc | Fem | Neut |
| Nominative | ὅδε | ἥδε | τόδε | οἵδε | αἵδε | τάδε |
| Genitive | τοῦδε | τῆσδε | τοῦδε | τῶνδε | τῶνδε | τῶνδε |
| Dative | τῷδε | τῇδε | τῷδε | τοῖσδε | ταῖσδε | τοῖσδε |
| Accusative | τόνδε | τήνδε | τόδε | τούσδε | τάσδε | τάδε |

> Notes on the forms of ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε:

- ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε is the article + the enclitic particle -δε. The enclitic nature of -δε accounts for the accents appearing on the masculine and feminine nominative forms (while the article forms are proclitics) and for the accents remaining what they are on the article on forms like τήνδε, τούσδε, and τάσδε, which seem to be "breaking" the rule about circumflex accents on a long penult when the ultima is short. 

**Declension of οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο**

| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem | Neut | Masc | Fem | Neut |
| Nominative | οὗτος | αὕτη | τοῦτο | οὗτοι | αὗται | ταῦτα |
| Genitive | τούτου | ταύτης | τούτου | τούτων | τούτων | τούτων |
| Dative | τούτῳ | ταύτῃ | τούτῳ | τούτοῖς | ταύταις | τούτοις |
| Accusative | τούτον | ταύτην | τοῦτο | τούτους | ταύτας | ταῦτα |

> Notes on the forms of οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο:
- The stem follows a pattern similar to the article, with the stem starting in tau in most forms, but with a rough breathing instead in the masculine and feminine nominative forms, both singular and plural.
- The masculine and neuter forms have second declension endings with the diphthong **ου** in the stem, while the feminine forms have first decelension endings with the diphthong **αυ** in the stem.
- The exception in the feminine is the genitive plural, which is assimilated to the same form as the masculine and neuter genitvie plural, τούτων.
- The neuter nominative and accustive plural forms use the αυ diphthong in phonetic assimilation with its ending -α.
- The neuter singular nominative and accusative are a different kind of second declension ending (-ο instead of -ον).
- The persistent accent pattern is the accent on a long penult. Thus the accent does not move from the penult, and will be a circumflex when the ultima is short and an acute when the ultima is long.

**Declension of ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο**

| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem | Neut | Masc | Fem | Neut |
| Nominative | ἐκεῖνος  | ἐκείνη  | ἐκεῖνο  | ἐκεῖνοι | ἐκεῖναι  | ἐκεῖνα  |
| Genitive | ἐκείνου | ἐκείνης | ἐκείνου | ἐκείνων | ἐκείνων | ἐκείνων |
| Dative | ἐκείνῳ  | ἐκείνῃ | ἐκείνῳ | ἐκείνοις | ἐκείναις | ἐκείνοις  |
| Accusative | ἐκεῖνον | ἐκείνην | ἐκεῖνο | ἐκείνους | ἐκείνας | ἐκεῖνα |

> Notes on the forms of ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο:
- The masculine and neuter forms have second declension endings while the feminine forms have first decelension endings.
- The neuter singular nominative and accusative are a different kind of second declension ending (-ο instead of -ον).
- The persistent accent pattern is the accent on a long penult. Thus the accent does not move from the penult, and will be a circumflex when the ultima is short and an acute when the ultima is long.
