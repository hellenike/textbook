## The article: complete declension


### Forms of the article

The article modifying a noun agrees with it in gender, case, and number. There is a full paradigm of forms with all three genders in all cases and numbers, and it is important to learn to recognize these forms easily. Pay careful attention to and memorize the spelling, including accents, breathing marks, and iota subscripts, on these forms. There is no vocative form of the article.

| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem | Neut | Masc | Fem | Neut |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Nominative | ὁ | ἡ | τό | οἱ | αἱ | τά |
| Genitive | τοῦ | τῆς | τοῦ | τῶν | τῶν | τῶν |
| Dative | τῷ | τῇ | τῷ | τοῖς | ταῖς | τοῖς |
| Accusative | τόν | τήν | τό | τούς | τάς | τά |

> Note that the alpha in the neuter nominative and accusative plural form, τά, is a short alpha, while the alpha in the feminine accusative plural form, τάς, is a long alpha.  
> The accent pattern of the article is that of a persistent accent on the ultima: acite in nominative and accusative cases — with the important exception here of the *proclitic* (unaccented) forms in the masculine/feminine nominative forms ὁ, ἡ, οἱ, αἱ — and circumflex on the genitive and dative forms.

### Some uses of the article

- Like the English definite article, the ancient Greek article may modify its noun by making it definite or particular: ἡ οἰκία "the house"
- If indicated by the context, the article can convey a possessive adjective: ὁ ἀνὴρ ἐκ **τῆς** οἰκίας ἦλθεν, "The man went out of **his** house" 
- Differently from English, however, the article may be used to denote a general class, οἱ ἄνθρωποι "people" or "humans" 
- Also differently from English, the article is frequently used with a proper noun, exs. ὁ Ἐρατοσθένης  "Eratosthenes"; αἱ Ἀθῆναι "Athens" or with abstract nouns, ex. ἡ δημοκρατία "democracy"
- The article has "noun-making" powers: the article can be used with another part of speech, such as infinitives, participles, adjectives, and even particles, to create nouns or "substantives." We will see in more detail later in this module how it is used this way with adjectives.
