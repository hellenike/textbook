## The article: complete declension


### Forms of the article

The table below lists all forms of the article. 

| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem | Neut | Masc | Fem | Neut |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Nominative | ὁ | ἡ | τό | οἱ | αἱ | τά |
| Genitive | τοῦ | τῆς | τοῦ | τῶν | τῶν | τῶν |
| Dative | τῷ | τῇ | τῷ | τοῖς | ταῖς | τοῖς |
| Accusative | τόν | τήν | τό | τούς | τάς | τά |


Some points to note:

- There is no vocative form of the article.
- Note that the alpha in the neuter nominative and accusative plural form, τά, is a short alpha, while the alpha in the feminine accusative plural form, τάς, is a long alpha.  
-  The accent pattern of the article is that of a persistent accent on the ultima: acite in nominative and accusative cases — with the important exception here of the *proclitic* (unaccented) forms in the masculine/feminine nominative forms ὁ, ἡ, οἱ, αἱ — and circumflex on the genitive and dative forms.
