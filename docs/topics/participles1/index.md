## Participles: introduction

Participles are a kind of adjective created from a verb. They share qualities of both verbs and adjectives (and in fact, the ancient Greek grammatical term for "participle" is μετοχή, literally, "a sharing").  Like any other adjective, participles have gender, case and number, and agree with the noun they describe in all those properties. But like other verb forms, participles have tense and voice, and function alongside finite verbs as a second kind of verbal unit.


English has a very limited set of participles.  We can add *ing* to a verb stem to create a participle in a present tense and active voice.  In a phrase like the cliché "babbling brook", "brook" is a noun described by the adjective "babbling". "Babbling" is a participle in the active voice: we're saying that "the brook babbles."  It's also in the present tense: the brook is babbling as we speak.

We can also add *ed* to a verb stem to create a participle in a past tense and passive voice.  The phrase "dreaded news" describes the noun "news" with an adjective made from the verb "to dread".  The voice is passive: the news is not the active subject dreading something, but the passive subject, the thing that is dreaded.  The tense is past: the news was already dreaded before we speak.

Participles: a verbal unit

Participles: an adjective


When you look at a Greek sentence, make a habit of beginning by identifying the principal clause.  Normally, in connected prose this will have at least two elements:  a verb, and either a conjunction or particle connecting the sentence to its context.


## The main verb

>Find the main verb before you do anything else!


Most frequently, the principle verb will be a conjugated form in the indicative mood.

Some possible exceptions include commands in the imperative, negative commands in the subjunctive, wishes in the optative, or future less vivid conditions with the main verb (the apodosis of the condition) in the optative.

If a particle such as ἄν or εἴθε appears with the main verb, note this.

## Complements to the main verb


If the main verb is used with a supplementary participle (e.g., φαίνομαι, τυγχάνω), find the participle.

If the main verb requires a complementary infinitive (e.g., ἐθέλὡ), find the infinitive.

If the main verb introduces indirect statement, identify the structure of the indirect statement (accusative subject + infinitive after verbs of speaking;  participle after verbs of thinking or perceiving).

Does your verb take an object?  Make sure you know how the verb and object are constructed (e.g., ἀκούω is constructed with a
genitive for source, or person, you hear from, but accusative for the thing you hear).  Find any objects (direct or indirect) of the main verb .

## The connecting word


Greek sentences regularly connect the main clause of a sentence to the larger context by a conjunction (such as καί) or a particle
(such as δέ).  Identifying how the main clause is connected to what precedes or follows will help you understand the logic of the sentence. It will also help you understand the syntax of the sentence, since you will not mistakenly interpret the conjunction or particle as
coordinating parts of the same sentence.
