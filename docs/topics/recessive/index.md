## Recessive accent




The accent on finite verb forms in ancient Greek is described as recessive, meaning the accent recedes as far back from the end of the word as the possible, in accordance with the set of rules governing accentuation.

The rules that apply to these forms:
1. The accent cannot recede further back than the antepenult. Therefore, the accent will reside on one of the last three syllables of a finite verb form, even if it has more than three syllables.

2. If the ultima is long, the accent recedes to the penult and is an acute accent on the penult.

3. If the ultima is short:[reminder that final -αι and -οι are usually short]
a. if there are three or more syllables in the form, the accent will recede to the antepenult and be an acute accent on that syllable.
b. if there are two syllables, the accent will be on the penult. Since the ultima is short, when the penult is accented its form will depend on the quantity of the penult syllable: if it is short, the accent will be acute. If it is long, the accent will be a circumflex.

Other situations with circumflex accents on finite verb forms:
4. As we learn contracted verb forms, where two vowels have combined to one sound, we will see circumflex accents mark those contractions when possible under the rules for circumflex accents. [do we explain compound verb forms yet? a couple of examples already in Lysias I.6]

5. If the verb form is only one syllable and it is long, it will carry a circumflex accent.


Practice for recessive accents:
On the following finite verb forms, determine the correct placement and type of accent in accordance with the rules of recessive accents, and then put it there. [Verb forms from Lysias I.6–11]
