## Direct and indirect objects

Two functions that nouns can have in a clause is to act as the direct object of the verb, or as the indirect object of the verb. In order for a verb to take an object, it must be a *transitive* verb, a verb that expresses an action that acts upon a recipient. The recipient of the action is called the *direct object*. Some verbs may express actions that also involve a secondary recipient: that is the *indirect object*. 



In ancient Greek, the **accusative** case is the most common way of expressing a *direct object*. 

The **dative** case is the most common way of expressing the *indirect object*.

### Direct Object: function of the accusative case




### Indirect Object: function of the dative case
