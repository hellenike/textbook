## Primary and secondary sequence

In module 4, you learned the formation of the optative mood and its use in indirect statements in secondary sequence. As we learn further kinds of subordinate clauses, we will see that many kinds of subordinate clauses in secondary sequence can use the optative mood. Subordinate clauses in primary sequence often use the subjunctive mood. 

Recall that the tense of the main verb determines the sequence of moods. The sentence is in primary sequence if the tense of the main verb expresses action in the present or future (present, future, perfect). The sentence is in secondary sequence if the tense of the main verb expresses action in the past (imperfect, aorist, or pluperfect).

| Sequence | Tense of the main verb | Mood of the verb in subordinate clause |
| --- | --- | ---|
| Primary | Present, Future, or Perfect | Subjunctive |
| Secondary | Imperfect, Aorist, or Pluperfect | Optative |
