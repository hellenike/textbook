## The common irregular athematic verb εἰμί, εἶμι, φημί 

You have already been introduced in Module 1 to the verb εἰμί “be, exist” and its 3rd person imperfect indicative, ἦν ‘she/he/it was’. We now add to that with other forms as well as learn forms of two other common and irregular athematic verbs, εἶμι “will go” and φημί “speak, say” 

### Principal parts and English equivalents:

εἰμί, ἔσομαι, —, —, —, — 	*be, exist* Note: enclitic in the present indicative

εἶμι, —, —, —, —, —  *(will) go, come*

φημί, φήσω, ἔφησα, —, —, — *say, assert, affirm* Note: enclitic in the present indicative, active voice only in all tenses/moods

**Notes on forms or usage**
- Enclitic forms (present indicative of εἰμί and φημί) are shown with the accent on the ultima for two-syllable forms, which is how they would be accented if they ever are. But you will often see them without an accent.
- The present indicative forms may have a nu-moveable, which is shown in parentheses.
– Two distinct forms exist for the third plural present optative.
— When you see the accented forms ἔστι(ν), it is asserting existence, similar to English “There is,” “There exists,” or even “It is possible.” It will often come at the beginning of the clause.
