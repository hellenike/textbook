## Further Adjective Declensions

### Third Declension Adjectives in -ής, -ές 

The adjectives ἀληθής, ἀληθές (‘true’) and ψευδής, ψευδές (‘false’) follow a common third declension adjective pattern to learn, where the epsilon at the end of the stem contracts with the vowels of the case ending. These belong to the “consonant” declension because the noun stem used to end with a sigma, which in the historical development of Greek, drops out between vowels (“loss of intervocalic sigma”). The first form is both masculine and feminine singular, the second is the neuter singular.

#### Learn the declension of ἀληθής, ἀληθές:

								
| Case 	|	M/F Singular |	N Singular |	M/F Plural	|	N Plural |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative	|	ἀληθής	|	ἀληθές		|	ἀληθεῖς |	ἀληθῆ |
| Genitive	|	ἀληθοῦς |	ἀληθοῦς 	|	ἀληθῶν |	ἀληθῶν |
| Dative	|	ἀληθεῖ 	|	ἀληθεῖ		|	ἀληθέσι |	ἀληθέσι |
| Accusative	|	ἀληθῆ 	|	ἀληθές 		| ἀληθεῖς 	| ἀληθῆ |

### Common slightly irregular 2-1-2 adjectives

Learn also the following three very common adjectives and their only slightly irregular declensions (they are mostly 2-1-2). Irregular forms are **emphasized** like this for your attention.

**ἄλλος, ἄλλη, ἄλλο**  _another, other_; with the article, _the rest_. Declines as a regular 2-1-2 adjective except for the neuter singular nominative and accusative, which is **ἄλλο** rather than the expected ἄλλον. Note that the accent on the penult distinguishes the neuter nominative/accusative plural ἄλλα from the conjunction ἀλλά (‘but’).

**μέγας, μεγάλη, μέγα** _big, large, great_. Note the irregular forms in the masculine and neuter nominative and accusative. Otherwise a 2-1-2 declension pattern with a persistent accent on the penult.

									
| Case  | M Singular	|	F Singular	|	N Singular	|	M Plural |		F Plural	|	N Plural |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative |	**μέγας** |	μεγάλη	| **μέγα**	|	μεγάλοι |	μεγάλαι |	μεγάλα	|						
| Genitive |	μεγάλου	| μεγάλης |	μεγάλου  |	μεγάλων |	μεγάλων | 	μεγάλων	|

| Accusative |	**μέγαν** |	μεγάλην |	**μέγα** |		μεγάλους |	μεγάλας |	μεγάλα 	|	

**πολύς, πολλή, πολύ** _much, many_. Irregular forms also in the masculine and neuter nominative and accusative. Otherwise a 2-1-2 declension pattern with a persistent accent on the ultima.
