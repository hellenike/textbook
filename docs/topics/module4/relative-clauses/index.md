## Relative clauses

Relative clauses are dependent clauses, connected to an independent clause in a sentence. Basic relative clauses use finite verbs in the indicative mood.

The relative clause begins with a relative pronoun, which refers to a noun or pronoun in the independent clause, its *antecedent*. Because the relative clause is modifying that noun or pronoun, the form of the relative pronoun matches the antecedent in **gender** and **number**. Because the relative clause is its own verbal unit, with its own subject and verb, the **case** of the relative pronoun is determined by its function in its own clause. 

#### Examples of relative clauses

Identify the relative pronoun in the following sentences. What is its antecedent? What are the boundaries of the relative clause (where does it begin and where does it end)? What form of the relative pronoun would be used in ancient Greek (what is the gender, case, and number)?

- The woman who goes to the market brought messages to my wife.
- The house that I own has two floors.
- The husband narrated to the jurors the events which occurred.
