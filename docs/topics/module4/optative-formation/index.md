## Formation of the optative


### Forming the present optative of thematic (and non-contracted) verbs and athematic verbs like δείκνυμι

- (1) start by removing the first person singular ending (-ω or -ομαι / -μι or -μαι) and accent from the first principal part 

> κελεύω -> κελευ-
>  
> δείκνυμι  -> δεικνυ-


- (2) Add the appropriate ending. For this module, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural.  Note that in all person-number combinations of the present optative, the middle and passive have identical endings.

| Number  | Active  | Middle/Passive  |
|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -οι   | -οιτο   |
| 3rd plural  | -οιεν   | -οιντο   |


- (3) Apply recessive accent. Note that the final -οι in the optative form counts as *long* for accentuation (in contrast to the final -οι in the second declension masculine or feminine nominative plural, which counts as short for purposes of accentuation).

**Example of κελεύω "command"**

| Person and Number | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  κελεύοι   | κελεύοιτο  | κελεύοιτο |
| 3rd plural | κελεύοιεν | κελεύοιντο  | κελεύοιντο  |


### Forming the aorist optative of thematic verbs and athematic verbs like δείκνυμι

Just as you learned to do for the aorist indicative active and middle, for the aorist optative active and middle you will use the third principal part. 

For the aorist optative passive, you will use the sixth principal part, as you did for the aorist passive indicative. 

As with the indicative, you will only distinguish between "first" and "second" aorists with the third principal part and the forms created from it. A reminder: you can recognize a first aorist by a third principal ending in -α or -άμην. Verbs that have a second aorist have a third principal part that ends in -ον or -όμην.

Recall that principal parts are all 1st person indicative mood verb forms. The third and sixth principal parts, as aorist indicative forms, carry the augment that is one indication of a past tense in the indicative. Optative forms *never* carry an augment, so in forming aorist optative verb forms, you must **remove the augment** from the principal part. When the augment is an epsilon that has been added as a prefix, it is simple to remove it. When the augment is a lengthening of a vowel that begins the stem, you can often look to the first principal part to see what the unaugmented form is. Irregular verbs will, as we have come to expect, offer more variety between first and third principal parts stems, and so we need to use more caution in thinking about what the unaugmented stem will be.

#### First aorist optative

- (1a) for the active and middle, start by removing the first person singular ending (-α or -άμην), the augment, and the accent from the third principal part:

> ἐκέλευσα  -> κελευσ-
>  
> ἔδειξα  -> δειξ-
> 
> ἡγησάμην -> ἡγησ- (compare the first prinicpal part ἡγέομαι, which also begins with an eta) 

- (1b) for the aorist passive, start by removing the first person singular ending (-ην), the augment, and the accent from the sixth principal part:

> ἐκελεύσθην -> κελευσθ-
> 
> ἐδείχθην -> δειχθ-

- (2) Add the appropriate ending. For this module, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural. Note that there are two possible endings in both active forms and in the third person plural passive forms. 


|   | Active  | Middle  | Passive  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -αι or -ειε/-ειεν  | -αιτο   | -είη  |
|  3rd plural | -αιεν or -ειαν   | -αιντο   | -είησαν or -εῖεν  |

- (3) Apply recessive accent. Note that the final -αι in the optative form counts as *long* for accentuation (in contrast to the final -αι in the first declension feminine or masculine nominative plural, which counts as short for purposes of accentuation).

**Example of first aorist optative from δείκνυμι "show"**

| Person and Number | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular | δείξαι or δείξειε or δείξειεν   | δείξαιτο   | δειχθείη  |
| 3rd plural | δείξαιεν or δείξειαν  | δείξαιντο   | δειχθείησαν or δειχθεῖεν   |



#### Second aorist optative

- (1a) for the active and middle, start by removing the first person singular ending (-ον or -όμην), augment, and accent from the third principal part:

> ἔβαλον  -> βαλ-
>  
> ἦλθον  -> ἐλθ-
> 
> ἐγενόμην -> γεν- 

- (1b) for the aorist passive, start by removing the first person singular ending (-ην), augment, and accent from the sixth principal part:

> ἐβλήθην -> βλήθ-


- (2) Add the appropriate ending. For this module, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural. Note that the second aorist active and middle endings are the same as those of the present active and middle optative. Therefore, it is the difference in the *stem* that will indicate that these are aorist forms. (Recall that we had to notice the same difference with the second aorist indicative compared to the imperfect indicative in the active and middle voices.)

|   | Active  | Middle  | Passive  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -οι   | -οιτο   | -είη   |
|  3rd plural | -οιεν  | -οιντο   | -είησαν or -εῖεν  |

- (3) Apply recessive accent. This final -οι in the optative form counts as *long* for accentuation, as it did in the present endings.

**Example of second aorist optative from βάλλω "throw"**

| Person and Number | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular | βάλοι    | βάλοιτο   | βληθείη  |
| 3rd plural | βάλοιεν  | βάλοιντο   | βληθείησαν or βληθεῖεν  |
