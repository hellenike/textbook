## The pronoun αὐτός



### Personal pronouns

The designation "personal" for personal pronouns is connected to the idea of "person" as a feature of verbs: that is, first person, second, person, and third person just as we use those terms for verbs. Thus for these pronouns, gender and number have a relationship with person. First person ("I" in the singular and "we" in the plural) and second person ("you") personal pronouns are understood to have grammatical gender corresponding to embodied gender of the person or persons they are referring to. Third person pronouns ("he, she, it" in singular, "they" in plural) in ancient Greek have different forms in the singular of grammatical gender depending on the gender (grammatical or embodied) of the person or thing referred to. That is, grammatical gender of nouns will be reflected in the grammatical gender of the pronoun that refers to it.

Pronouns are among the words in English that still have cases. We have a "subjective" case of pronouns that is like the nominative: I, we, he, she. The "objective" case of pronouns are used for objects of verbs or objects of prepositions, and so that is what we will use for the "oblique" cases (a category covering the genitive, dative, and accusative cases) in ancient Greek: me, us, him, her, them. In English, we no longer have distinctions for the second person in cases, just as with number: "you" is used in all cases and numbers, and "it" is also used for both the subjective and objective cases.

#### Forms of personal pronouns for first and second persons

| Case | 1st person | English equivalent | 2nd person | English equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   | **singular** |   | **singular** |  |
| nominative | ἐγώ | I | σύ | you |
| genitive | μου / ἐμοῦ | (of) me | σου / σοῦ | (of) you |
| dative | μοι / ἐμοί  | (to/for) me | σοι / σοί | (to/for) you |
| accusative | με / ἐμέ | me | σε / σέ | you |
|   | **plural** |   | **plural** |   |
| nominative | ἡμεῖς  | we | ὑμεῖς  | you |
| genitive | ἡμῶν | (of) us | ὑμῶν | (of) you |
| dative | ἡμῖν | (to/for) us | ὑμῖν | (to/for) you |
| accusative | ἡμᾶς  | us | ὑμᾶς  | you |

We have already seen in studying person with verb forms that ancient Greek verbs do not require a separate pronoun to express the subject. Because they are not needed, nominative personal pronouns are not used to express the subject unless the speaker wants to place special emphasis on that subject. The English equivalent of using the nominative pronoun would be heavy stress and perhaps even pointing when spoken, or underlining or italics in writing, such as "**_We_** are studying Greek."

The singular of the first and second person pronouns also have emphatic and unemphatic forms that operate in a similar way. The first form listed above is unemphatic. If the speaker wants to emphasize **_me_** or **_you_** in the sentence, then the second form will be used. In the first person singular, note that the emphatic form involves both an extra letter/syllable and an accent, while in the second person singular the difference is indicted solely by the accent. The unemphatic forms of both the first and second person singular pronouns are listed without an accent. They belong to a class of words called **enclitics**. (See next section.)

#### Forms of personal pronoun for third person, singular and plural

The personal pronoun for the third person is αὐτός, αὐτή, αὐτό. It has masculine, feminine, and neuter forms, like English does in "he, she, it." It declines with second conjugation endings in the masculine and neuter, with the exception of the neuter singular nominative and accustive αὐτό, and with first conjugation endings in the feminine. The persistent accent is on the ultima and follows that pattern of acute on the nominative and accustive forms, and a circumflex on the genitive and dative forms. 

The nominative forms are not used as personal pronouns, to mean sinmply "he, she, it, they." Recall that ancient Greek does not need a nominative pronoun since the verb form contains the information about the person and number of the subject. (This pronoun has two other uses that we will learn later when the nominative is used). So the following introduces only those cases and forms that are used for the pronoun in the oblique cases "him, her, it, them."  


| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem | Neut | Masc | Fem | Neut |
| Genitive | αὐτοῦ  | αὐτῆς  | αὐτοῦ | αὐτῶν | αὐτῶν | αὐτῶν |
| Dative | αὐτῷ  | αὐτῇ | αὐτῷ | αὐτοῖς | αὐταῖς  | αὐτοῖς  |
| Accusative | αὐτόν | αὐτήν | αὐτό | αὐτούς  | αὐτάς  | αὐτά  |
