**Notes on forms or usage**


- Enclitic forms (present indicative of εἰμί and φημί) are shown with the accent on the ultima for two-syllable forms, which is how they would be accented if they ever are. But you will often see them without an accent.
- The present indicative forms may have a nu-moveable, which is shown in parentheses.
– Two distinct forms exist for the third plural present optative.
— When you see the accented forms ἔστι(ν), it is asserting existence, similar to English “There is,” “There exists,” or even “It is possible.” It will often come at the beginning of the clause.
