**Notes on forms or usage**
- Enclitic forms (present indicative of εἰμί and φημί) are shown with the accent on the ultima for two-syllable forms, which is how they would be accented if they ever are. But you will often see them without an accent.
- The present indicative forms may have a nu-moveable, which is shown in parentheses.
– Two distinct forms exist for the third plural present optative.
— When you see the accented forms ἔστι(ν), it is asserting existence, similar to English “There is,” “There exists,” or even “It is possible.” It will often come at the beginning of the clause.

	Third singular	εἶσι (or εἶσιν)
	
	Third plural	ἴασι (or ἴασιν)

**Notes on forms or usage**
- εἶμι has a future sense to its present indicative forms in Attic Greek prose. Its forms are used for the future of ἔρχομαι in Attic prose instead of those derived from ἐλεύσομαι (the second principal part of ἔρχομαι). 


**φημί**

Present active participle	  φάς, φᾶσα, φάν	
				  in Attic Greek, borrowed from a related verb: φάσκων, φάσκουσα, φάσκον

Present active infinitive	  φάναι 

**Notes on forms or usage**
- The 3rd principal part of φημί, ἔφησα, is a regular first aorist, but only active forms are made from it. The imperfect is more commonly used than the aorist. Distinguish the present active participle φάς, φᾶσα, φάν from the aorist active, φήσας, φήσασα, φήσαν.
- φημί can mean “say yes, say so” and its negative οὐ φημί means “say no, deny, refuse” rather than “not say.”
