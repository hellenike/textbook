## Indirect statement with the infinitive and accusative subject


The verb of saying φημί and also verbs of thinking or believing, such as νομίζω and ἡγέομαι, often represent the original direct statement as a subject accusative plus an infinitive of the same tense as the original verb in the direct speech. In this type of indirect speech, the tense of the infinitive shows time as well as aspect. If the original verb was in the imperfect, the present infinitive can be used to replace it in indirect statement.
 
#### Examples

- νομίζει Ἐρατοσθένη τοῦτο πράττειν. ‘He thinks that Eratosthenes is doing this.’
- νομίζει Ἐρατοσθένη τοῦτο πράξαι. ‘He thinks that Eratosthenes did this.’

The same tense of the infinitive is used after a past tense verb of thinking in Greek, because it represents the tense of the original statement, but in English the same changes to the tense occur as we saw above:
- ἐνόμισεν Ἐρατοσθένη τοῦτο πράττειν. ‘He thought that Eratosthenes was doing this.’
- ἐνόμισεν Ἐρατοσθένη τοῦτο πράξαι. ‘He thought that Eratosthenes had done this.’

If the subject of the infinitive is the same as the subject of the introductory verb, often no separate subject is expressed: 
- νομίζει τοῦτο πράττειν. ‘He thinks that he (=the same person) is doing this.’ 

If a predicate adjective is used in the indirect statement, it is nominative: 
- ἐνόμισεν ἀγαθὸς εἶναι. ‘He thought that he was good.’
