## Indirect statement with the infinitive and accusative subject

To express indirect statement after φημί and other verbs refering to thinking or believing (such as νομίζω and ἡγέομαι), one common construction is to put the verb of the indirect statement in a form that is new to us, called the  *infinitive*. Our term "infinitive" derives from the Greek grammarians: they called this form the "unbounded" (or "infinite") form because it does not specify a person or number: only the tense and voice. 

Similar to participles (which also have tense and voice, but no person, number or mood), the voice of the infinitive expresses the same ideas that the active, middle and passive voices convey in other verb forms, while the tense shows time as well as aspect. 

When the subject of the indirect statement is different from the subject of the main verb, it appears in the accusative case.

 
#### Examples

We'll consider how to formation the infinitive in the following section. In these examples, consider how time relates to the main verb in English and in Greek.


**A main verb in the present tense (νομίζει)** 

Note that Ἐρατοσθένη is the accusative singular of the name Ἐρατοσθένης, Ἐρατοσθένους.

πράττειν is a *present active* infinitive, so the action is open-ending or incomplete at the time of the main verb.

    νομίζει Ἐρατοσθένη τοῦτο πράττειν.
    
    ‘He thinks that Eratosthenes is doing this.’


πράξαι is an *aorist active* infinitive, so the action is completed at the time of the main verb.

    νομίζει Ἐρατοσθένη τοῦτο πράξαι. 
    ‘He thinks that Eratosthenes did this.’

**A main verb in the aorist tense (ἐνόμισεν)** 

    ἐνόμισεν Ἐρατοσθένη τοῦτο πράττειν. 
    ‘He thought that Eratosthenes was doing this.’

    ἐνόμισεν Ἐρατοσθένη τοῦτο πράξαι. 
    ‘He thought that Eratosthenes had done this.’


As these examples show, the tense of the infinitive is not affected by the tense of the main verb. Don't by misled by the way English changes the tense of an indirect statement: the Greek infinitive will typically be in the same tense as the origianl statement (or if the original verb was in the imperfect, the present infinitive can be used express an ongoing action).


If the subject of the infinitive is the same as the subject of the introductory verb, often no separate subject is expressed:

    νομίζει τοῦτο πράττειν. 
    ‘He thinks that he (=the same person) is doing this.’ 


If a predicate adjective in this situation, it is nominative since it agrees with the subject of the main verb:

    ἐνόμισεν ἀγαθὸς εἶναι. 
    ‘He thought that he was good.’
