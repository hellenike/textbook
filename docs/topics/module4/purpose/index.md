## Purpose clauses


A purpose clause is a subordinate clause. As we have seen before, "clause" means it has its own subject and verb. "Subordinate" means that it is dependent on the main clause of the sentence and does not stand alone. Simple indicative dependent clauses, such as relative adverb and relative pronoun clauses, were introduced as dependent clauses eartlier in this module. The terms "dependent" and "subordinate" are interchangeable for our purposes. As the name indicates, *purpose* clauses explain the reason(s) behind the main action: why, or for what purpose, the action of the main clause was done. The verb of a purpose clause is never in the indicative mood.

Identify the purpose expressed in these English sentences:
- He told them everything so that they would understand.
- So that she wouldn't have to climb stairs, she slept on the first floor.
- The students practiced their Greek forms daily to learn them better.
- We live in order to love.

The structure of a purpose clause in ancient Greek has the following features:
- it is introduced by a specific subordinating conjunction: ἵνα, ὡς, or ὅπως
- if the verb in the purpose clause is negated, it is negated by μή 
- the verb within the purpose clause will be in the subjunctive or the optative mood, according to the tense of the verb in the clause that governs the purpose clause. The optative is used when that verb is in a secondary (or past) tense: since we have been practicing with the secondary tenses of the imperfect and aorist indicative, we will practice in this module with purpose clauses that use the optative mood. Next semester, we will add the subjunctive mood and see their use in purpose clauses that are governed by clauses whose verb is in a primary tense like the present or future.

### Practice with purpose clauses

In the reading for Module 2, the house and living arrangements of Euphiletos were described. In the speech, purpose clauses explain a bit more. They are modified here to use the optative forms. Let's go back and see why the usual arrangements were flipped, as we practice purpose clauses, as well as simple indicative subordinate clauses, and participles, too.

In each of the following sections, identify the boundaries of each clause and the form of the verb in each. Which clauses are subordinate? Which are purpose clauses?

ἐπειδὴ δὲ τὸ παιδίον ἐγένετο αὐτοῖς, ἡ μήτηρ αὐτὸ ἐθήλαζεν: ἵνα δὲ μή κινδυνεύοι κατὰ τῆς κλίμακος καταβαίνουσα, ἐγὼ μὲν ἄνω διῃτώμην, αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες κάτω. (modified from Lysias 1.9)

προϊόντος δὲ τοῦ χρόνου, ἧκον μὲν ἀπροσδοκήτως ἐξ ἀγροῦ, μετὰ δὲ τὸ δεῖπνον τὸ παιδίον ἐβόα καὶ ἐδυσκόλαινεν ὑπὸ τῆς θεραπαίνης ἐπίτηδες λυπούμενον, ἵνα ταῦτα ποιοῖ. ὁ γὰρ ἄνθρωπος ἔνδον ἦν. (modified from Lysias 1.11)
