## Formation of the infinitive

To form the infinitive, use the endings in the following chart with the stems you already known. As a kind of noun form, infinitives have persistent accent, as you can see from the perfect infinitives and second aorist infinitives, which clearly are not recessive. Notice also that second aorist infinitives use the same endings as the present infinitive, but, like the active participle, with a different persistent accent.



| Tense | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Present | -ειν | -εσθαι | -εσθαι |
| First aorist | -αι | -ασθαι | -ασθαι |
| Second aorist | -εῖν | -έσθαι | -έσθαι |
| Perfect | -έναι  | -σθαι | -σθαι |


Applying these endings to the thematic verb κελεύω, we have this set of infinitives:


| Tense | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | ---  |
| Present | κελεύειν|  κελεύεσθαι |   κελεύεσθαι |
| Aorist | κελεῦσαι | κελεύσασθαι | κελευσθῆναι |
| Perfect |  κεκελευκέναι|  κεκελεύσθαι | κεκελεύσθαι |

For a deponent verb like γίγνομαι, with no active forms in the present or aorist, we would have present middle infintive γίγνεσθαι, and (from its third part ἐγενόμην), the second aorist middle γενέσθαι.



Athematic (-μι) verbs work identically:


| Tense | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | ---  |
| Present | δεικνύειν|  δεικνύεσθαι |   δεικνύεσθαι |
| Aorist | δεῖξαι | δείξασθαι | δειχθῆσαι |
| Perfect |  δεδειχέναι| δεδείχθαι   |  δεδείχθαι |


For a deponent athematic verb like δύναμαι, with no active forms in the present or aorist, we would have

Present middle infinitive from δύναμαι —> δύνασθαι 


#### Thematic contract verbs
The short vowel at the end of the stem contracts with the vowel of the infinitive ending
- Epsilon-contract verbs: ε + ει = ει ; ε + ε = ει 
Present active infinitive of ποιέω  —> ποιεῖν 
Present middle/passive infinitive of ποιέω —> ποιεῖσθαι 

- Alpha-contract verbs: α + ει normally = ᾳ but in this case α (long); α + ε = α (long)
Present active infinitive of ὁράω  —> ὁρᾶν 
Present middle/passive infinitive of ὁράω —> ὁρᾶσθαι
