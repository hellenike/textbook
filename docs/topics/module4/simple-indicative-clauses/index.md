## Simple indicative clauses


Another possible way of structuring sentences involves making one clause (or multiple clauses) *dependent* on another clause. 

We recognize a clause as "independent" if it can stand on its own as a sentence, even if it is connected by coordination with other independent clauses, as in the previous section. 

A dependent clause further explains or defines the independent clause that it is attached to. It is recognized by the fact that as it is structured in this sentence, it cannot stand on its own because it does not express a complete thought. As it is structured with the independent, or "main," clause, the dependent clause does have defined boundaries, so that it is clear which words belong to which clause. Recognizing those boundaries is important to correctly reading and understanding a sentence with multiple clauses.

One common type of dependent clause is structured by a relative adverb or a relative pronoun. The word "relative" indicates that the word establishes and shows a relationship between the action expressed in the dependent clause and that expressed in the independent clause.

Relative adverbs, such as "when, after, since, because" in English, show and define a temporal or causal relationship between the action of the relative adverbial (dependent) clause and the action of the main clause. 
- "When our child was born, I was already trusting my wife."
- "After my mother died, all my problems started."

One ancient Greek relative adverb is **ἐπειδή** which can mean "when," "after" or "since." Notice its resemblance to the adverb you have already learned, ἔπειτα "then, next."

Relative pronouns, "who, which, that," are used to create a clause that further describes or defines a noun in the main clause. In the next section, we will introduce the relative pronoun in ancient Greek and learn in more detail how they form relative clauses.
