## The optative mood (ἡ εὐκτικὴ ἔγκλισις)

Up until now, we have seen finite verb forms only in the indicative mood, but recall that ancient Greek verbs have four moods: 

1. the indicative mood, used to make factual statements
2. the imperative mood, used to give commands
3. the subjunctive mood
4. the optative mood

Both the subjunctive and optative refer to potential or possible action in a variety of expressions. Subordinate clauses in secondary sequence are the first examples we have encountered of verbs in the optative mood.

The strange-sounding term "optative" is a translation of the Greek grammatical term ἡ εὐκτικὴ ἔγκλισις, literally, "the form expressing a wish." While expressing a wish is one function of the optative when it is used as the main verb of a sentence, it appears much more frequently in subordinate clauses after a verb in a secondary tense. (For more information about independent uses of the optative, please refer to the section "Beyond Lysias 1.")

### Important things to know about the optative:

- The meaning of the optative mood and therefore the way we translate an optative verb form is entirely dependent on its context, its use in that particular clause. You must always first identify the type of "verbal chunk" an optative verb belongs to before you can decide how to translate it. Therefore, we will not give translations to optative forms in the explanation of how to form them.
- The "tense" of a verb in the optative mood represents the *aspect* of the action, not the *time*. A present optative expresses ongoing or continuous action, not necessarily action in the present time. An aorist optative expresses a single action, not necessarily action in the past.
- Forming these verbs requires adding a new set of endings onto the same principal part stems that you have already learned.
