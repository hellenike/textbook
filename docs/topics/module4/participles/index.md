## Indirect statement with participles

Verbs of sense perception (such as seeing and hearing), knowing, and showing often take a supplementary participle to express indirect speech. This category includes verbs such as δείκνυμι, ὁράω, and ἀκούω. The tense of the participle retains the tense of the original statement, with the present participle used for an original imperfect verb.

If the subject of the indirect speech is different from the subject of the introductory verb, then it is expressed usually as a subject accusative with which the participle agrees in gender, case, and number. If the subject of the indirect speech is the same as the subject of the introductory verb, the participle is in the nominative and the subject is not generally repeated.

#### Examples

- ἐδείκνυ Ἐρατοσθένη ταῦτα πράττοντα.
‘He was showing that Eratosthenes was doing these things.’

- ἐδείκνυ Ἐρατοσθένη ταῦτα πράξαντα. 
‘He was showing that Eratosthenes had done these things.’

- οἱ μάρτυρες ἔδειξαν ἀκούοντες.
‘The witnesses demonstrated that they were listening.’


The verb ἀκούω takes a genitive object for the person heard, and an accusative for things heard:
- ὁ ἀνὴρ ἤκουσε τῆς γυναικός. 
‘The husband heard his wife.”

- ὁ ἀνὴρ ὕστερον πάντα ἤκουσε. 
‘The husband heard everything later.’

So a participle can modify the genitive object to represent what was being heard directly:
- ὁ ἀνὴρ ἤκουσε τῆς γυναικός τινι λεγούσης.  
‘The husband heard his wife speaking to someone.’

- ὁ ἀνὴρ ἤκουσε τῆς γυναικός ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας ἐρχομένης.  
‘The husband heard his wife going out of the house.’

Or the participle can represent indirect speech, with an accusative + participle:
- ὁ ἀνὴρ ἤκουσε τὴν γυναῖκά τινι λέγουσαν. 
‘The husband heard that his wife was speaking to someone.’

- ὁ ἀνὴρ ἤκουσε τὴν γυναῖκα ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας ἐλθοῦσαν. ‘The husband heard that his wife had gone out of the house.”
