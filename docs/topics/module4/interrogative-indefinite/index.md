## Interrogative and indefinite pronouns

Here are two more types of pronouns to those pronouns you have already learned: demonstrative pronouns, personal pronouns for the third person, and relative pronouns. As you have learned with those examples, these pronouns, **interrogative pronouns** and **indefinite pronouns**, take the place of nouns. As we will see, these pronouns resemble one another in ancient Greek, and so paying attention to accentuation is especially important in distinguishing them and understanding the clause in which they appear.

### Interrogative pronoun
Interrogative pronouns are so named because they are used to ask questions. The interrogative pronouns in English are *who?*, *which?*, and *what?*.
> Who goes there?
> 
> Whom did she see?
> 
> Which do they want?
> 
> What did he do?

We have already seen in that these English words are used as relative pronouns as well, and so the context of their use—-whether in a question or a relative clause--indicates the type of pronoun. Ancient Greek has different pronouns for these uses. As we saw with the relative pronoun, the English pronoun *who* when it is interrogative is inflected: *who* is nominative, *whose* is the possessive genitive, and *whom* is the objective case, used with prepositions in English and as the object of the verb, corresponding to other uses of the genitive, and uses of the dative and the accusative.

Like *which* and *what* in English, the interrogative pronoun in ancient Greek can also be used as an interrogative adjectives, modifying a noun.
> Which friend did she see?
> 
> What crime did he commit?

In ancient Greek the interrogative pronoun and adjective is τίς, τί. It belongs to the third declension, and it has one set of forms for the masculine and feminine, and another for the neuter. 

**Declension of τίς, τί** 

| Case | Singular |  | Plural |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | Masculine & Feminine | Neuter | Masculine & Feminine | Neuter | 
| Nominative | τίς | τί | τίνες | τίνα |
| Genitive | τίνος  or τοῦ | τίνος  or τοῦ | τίνων | τίνων |
| Dative | τίνι or τῷ | τίνι or τῷ | τίσι or τίσιν | τίσι or τίσιν |
| Accusative | τίνα | τί | τίνας | τίνα |

> Notes of the forms of τίς, τί

- The acute accent on these forms **always** remains acute, even when the rules of accentuation in a sentence say that it should become grave. We can compare that raised tone of the acute to the raised tone in asking a question in American English.
- More than one form exists in the gentive singular and dative singular, and the second form will have to be distinguished from the article in context. 
- The dative plural τίσι will have a nu-moveable added when the next word begins with a vowel. 

### Indefinite pronoun

Indefinite pronouns are used in place of or to refer to persons or things that are unspecified, unknown or uncertain. In English, indefinite pronouns include *anyone*, *anybody*, *anything*, *someone*, *somebody*, and *something*. 
> He talks to anyone.
> 
> Someone will come.
> 
> She did not find anything.

In ancient Greek the indefinite pronoun is τις, τι. Like the interrogative pronoun, it belongs to the third declension, and it has one set of forms for the masculine and feminine, and another for the neuter. The difference between the forms of two pronouns in ancient Greek lies in the accent alone.

The indefinite pronoun can also be used as an adjective, equivalent to English *some* or *any*.
> He was talking to some friends.
> 
> Any books left behind were removed.

**Declension of τις, τι** 

| Case | Singular |  | Plural |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | Masc. & Fem. | Neuter | Masc. & Fem. | Neuter | 
| Nominative | τις  | τι  | τινες  | τινα  |
| Genitive | τινος  or του  | τινος  or του  | τινων | τινων |
| Dative | τινι or τῳ | τινι or τῳ | τισι or τισιν | τισι or τισιν |
| Accusative | τινα  | τι  |τινας  | τινα  |

> Notes of the forms of τις, τι
- These forms are **enclitic**. See the following section for more on accent rules for enclitics. Accent is what distinguishes the interrogative form from the indefinite. According to the rules of accentuation, if the two-syllable forms are accented in a sentence, the accent will be on the ultima. That will continue to help to distinguish them from the interrogative forms, which are accented on the penult.
- More than one form exists in the gentive singular and dative singular, and the second form will have to be distinguished from the article in context. These forms are also enclitic.
- The dative plural τισι will have a nu-moveable added when the next word begins with a vowel.
