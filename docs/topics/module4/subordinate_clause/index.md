## Indirect statement introduced by a subordinate conjunction


To express indirect statement with a verb indicating speaking, such as λέγω, Greek can use the conjunction ὅτι or ὡς followed by a finite verb form. This is very similar to English, where we can use "that" to introduce a subordinate clause, as in, "She says that Eratosthenes was doing these things."  With the verb εἶπον or with λέγω in the active voice, this is the most common way to express indirect statement. When λέγω is in the passive voice ("it was said"), the infintive with an accusative subject (discussed above) is common.  
 
In the subordinate clause introduced by ὅτι or ὡς, the same tense and mood of the direct statement is retained. This makes it easy to know what tense the verb in the original statement was! English makes the tense of the verb in the indirect statement relative to the tense of the verb of speaking, so, for example, a past tense verb in the original statement in English is shifted to further in the past when the verb of speaking is put in the past.

#### Examples

> αὕτη λέγει ὅτι ὁ Ἐρατοσθένης ταῦτα ἔπραττεν. 
>
> ‘This woman says that Eratosthenes was doing these things.’  

> αὕτη εἶπεν ὅτι ὁ Ἐρατοσθένης ταῦτα ἔπραττεν.
>
> ‘This woman said that Eratosthenes had been doing these things.’


## Indirect statement in secondary sequence

Recall that the term *secondary tense*  to refer to a group of tenses referring to past time, (including the imperfect and aorist tenses).  When the verb of speaking is in a secondary tense, we say that any subordinate clause depending on it is in *secondary sequence*. In secondary sequence, the verb of the subordinate is often changed from the indicative to the *optative*, a mood we have not previously encountered.


| Sequence | Tense of the main verb | Mood of the verb in subordinate clause |
| --- | --- | ---|
| Primary | Present, Future, or Perfect | Subjunctive |
| Secondary | Imperfect, Aorist, or Pluperfect | Optative |

The sequence is called either "Primary" or "Secondary." Primary tenses of verbs are those that express action in the present or future, while secondary tenses are those that express action in the past. The subjunctive mood is associated with the primary tenses. The optative mood is associated with the secondary tenses.


We have been using verbs in the imperfect and aorist tenses. Therefore, we will be looking at how subordinate clauses operate in secondary sequence and use the optative. As we add the primary tenses in future modules, we will also add the subjunctive mood and subordinate clauses in primary sequence.



TENSE KEPT SAME

If the verb of speaking is in a secondary tense (imperfect, aorist, pluperfect), the mood of the verb in the indirect statement is often changed from the indicative to the optative of the same tense. Since there is no imperfect optative, the present optative is used to replace an imperfect indicative. The translation into English remains the same.

- αὕτη εἶπεν ὅτι ὁ Ἐρατοσθένης ταῦτα πράττοι.
‘This woman said that Eratosthenes had been doing these things.’
