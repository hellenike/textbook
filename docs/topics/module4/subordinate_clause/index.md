## Indirect statement introduced by a subordinate conjunction


To express indirect statement with a verb indicating speaking, such as λέγω, Greek can use the conjunction ὅτι or ὡς followed by a finite verb form. This is very similar to English, where we can use "that" to introduce a subordinate clause, as in, "She says that Eratosthenes was doing these things."  With the verb εἶπον or with λέγω in the active voice, this is the most common way to express indirect statement. When λέγω is in the passive voice ("it was said"), the infintive with an accusative subject (discussed above) is common.  
 
In the subordinate clause introduced by ὅτι or ὡς, the same tense and mood of the direct statement is retained. This makes it easy to know what tense the verb in the original statement was! English makes the tense of the verb in the indirect statement relative to the tense of the verb of speaking, so, for example, a past tense verb in the original statement in English is shifted to further in the past when the verb of speaking is put in the past.

**Examples**:

> αὕτη λέγει ὅτι ὁ Ἐρατοσθένης ταῦτα ἔπραττεν. 
>
> ‘This woman says that Eratosthenes was doing these things.’  

> αὕτη εἶπεν ὅτι ὁ Ἐρατοσθένης ταῦτα ἔπραττεν.
>
> ‘This woman said that Eratosthenes had been doing these things.’


### Indirect statement in secondary sequence

Recall that we use the term *secondary tense*  to refer to a group of tenses referring to past time (including the imperfect and aorist tenses). This is in contrast to *primary tenses* that express action in the present or future.



| Sequence | Tense of the main verb | Mood of the verb in subordinate clause |
| --- | --- | ---|
| Primary | Present, Future, or Perfect | Subjunctive |
| Secondary | Imperfect, Aorist, or Pluperfect | Optative |


When the main verb is in a primary tense, we say that any subordinate clause depending on it is in *primary sequence*; when the main verb is a secondary tense, we say that any of its subordinate clauses are in *secondary sequence*. 

As we will see in the following module, many kinds of subordinate clauses in secondary sequence can use the *optative mood*, a mood we have not previously encountered. When a subordinate clause expressing indirect statement after ὅτι or ὡς is in secondary, the verb of the subordinate clause is often changed from the indicative to the optative, keeping the same tense. Remember that the imperfect tense exists only in the indicative mood: there are no other moods, no participles, no infinitives of the imperfect. When the optative mood replaces an imperfect form, the present optative is used to express the idea of continued, repated or otherwise incomplete action.

In the following sentence, πράττοι is in the present tense of the optative:

> αὕτη εἶπεν ὅτι ὁ Ἐρατοσθένης ταῦτα πράττοι.
> 
> ‘This woman said that Eratosthenes was doing these things.’
