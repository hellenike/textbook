## Some uses of the infinitive

### Some uses of the infinitive
To start, we will learn two common uses of the infinitive: the complementary infinitive and the articular infinitive. There will be further uses to learn in this and future modules. 

#### Complementary infinitive
The complementary infinitive completes the meaning of verbs expressing wishing, wanting, commanding, requesting, expecting, choosing, and being capable. The negative for these types of infinitives is μή. 

Verbs we have already learned that can employ a complementary infinitive include δύναμαι, ἔχω (which means ‘be able’ when used with an infinitive), and κελεύω. 

Examples:
- οὐκ ἐδύνατο λέγειν  ‘he was not able to speak’ 
- ἐδύνατο μὴ λέγειν ‘he was able not to speak’
- εἶχον ταῦτα πράττειν ‘they were able to do these things’ 
- ἡ θεράπαινα ἐκελεύσθη ἔρχεσθαι εἰς ἀγοράν ‘the enslaved woman was ordered to go (to keep going) to the marketplace’

**Learn these two new verbs that use complementary infinitives**:
βούλομαι, βουλήσομαι, —, —, βεβούλημαι, ἐβουλήθην 	want, desire, wish
ἐθέλω, ἐθελήσω, ἠθέλησα, ἠθέληκα, —, — 	be willing, wish

Examples:
- ἐβούλοντο ταῦτα πράττειν ‘they wanted to be doing these things, they used to want to do these things’
- ἤθελον ταῦτα πράττειν ‘they were willing to do these things, they wished to be doing these things’

#### Articular Infinitive
When the infinitive is used as a noun, a neuter singular article may be used with it to emphasize its substantive nature and to show its case. The article must be used if the infinitive is being used in the genitive or dative case to make that case clear, or if the infinitive is used as the object of a preposition. In clauses where the infinitive is nominative or accusative, the article may be used or not. The use of the infinitive as a noun often corresponds to the gerund in English, a verbal noun that uses the -ing form of the verb (don’t confuse it with a participle). The tense of the articular infinitive shows aspect only. The negative is μή.

Examples:
- τὸ ταῦτα πράττειν κακὸν ἦν. ‘Doing these things was bad.’
Notice that although the infinitive is used as a substantive whose function is the subject of the clause, it still has “verbal” properties such as taking its own object. Notice that that object goes into attributive position.
- τὸ ταῦτα μὴ πράττειν κάκιον ἦν ‘Not doing these things was worse’ or ‘To not do these things was worse.’
- πρὸς τῷ ταῦτα πράττειν, ἄλλα ἔπραττεν. ‘In addition to doing these things, he was doing other things.’



Infinitives are a verbal form which do not limit person and number as finite verb forms do. They also do not have mood as finite verb forms do. Like other verbal forms, infinitives are formed using a verb’s principal parts.

Infinitives have **tense** and **voice**. 
- **Tense**: In ancient Greek the tenses for the infinitive include the present, the future, the aorist, and the perfect. We will learn the present and aorist tenses in this module. In some uses, tense represents aspect rather than time: the present represents an ongoing, continuous, or repeated aspect, and the aorist, the single or simple aspect. In other uses, tense does indicate something about the time of the action. As you learn different uses, learn these distinctions.

- **Voice**: there are infinitives forms for all three voices: active, middle, and passive.

To fully identify an infinitive, identify its tense, voice, that it is an infinitive, and what verb it comes from. For example, ποιεῖν (appears in Lysias 1.6 and Lysias 1.33) would be identified as: present active infinitive from ποιέω.
