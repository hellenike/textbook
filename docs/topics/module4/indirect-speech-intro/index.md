## Indirect speech: introduction






As we have already seen in Module 4, indirect speech (also called ‘indirect statement’ or ‘indirect discourse’) is way of representing some kind of verbal activity—speaking, asking, thinking, hearing, any representation of words in speech or thought. We began learning the construction of indirect speech in ancient Greek as a subordinate clause introduced by ὅτι or ὡς, which is similar to the English use of a subordinate clause introduced by that. We will now review that construction and add two other ways ancient Greek constructs indirect speech: by using an infinitive or by using a participle. Which construction is used depends on the type of verb introducing the indirect speech and on idiom, which also means that native speakers/writers may change these up. Some verbs may take two or even all three of these constructions, so the rules of which verbs introduce which construction are not hard and fast.

### Verbs that introduce indirect speech

Some verbs that introduce indirect speech that we have been working with:

- δείκνυμι, δείξω, ἔδειξα δέδειχα, δέδειγμαι, ἐδείχθην show, demonstrate
- ἡγέομαι, ἡγήσομαι, ἡγησάμην, —, ἥγημαι, ἡγήθην  think, consider, believe
- λέγω, λέξω, ἔλεξα or εἶπον, εἴρηκα, λέλεγμαι, ἐλέχθην  say, speak, tell
- ὁράω, ὄψομαι, εἶδον, ἑώρακα or ἑόρακα, ἑώραμαι or ὦμμαι, ὤφθην  see, look, understand
- φημί, φήσω, ἔφησα, —, —, —  say, assert, affirm

Now add:

- ἀκούω, ἀκούσομαι, ἤκουσα, ἀκήκοα, — , ἠκούσθην  hear, listen to
- νομίζω, νομιῶ, ἐνόμισα, νενόμικα, νενόμισμαι, ἐνομίσθην  think, believe





### 1. Indirect Speech as Subordinate Clause 

Verbs of saying, such as λέγω, are generally followed by a clause introduced by ὅτι or ὡς (“that”) with a finite verb. εἶπον and λέγω in the active use this construction, while λέγω is the passive (e.g., “it was said”) may take construction #2 below, with an infinitive. The verb ἀκούω may take this construction or #3 below, with a participle.
 
In the subordinate clause introduced by ὅτι or ὡς, the same tense and mood of the direct statement is retained. This makes it easy to know what tense the verb in the original statement was! English makes the tense of the verb in the indirect statement relative to the tense of the verb of speaking, so, for example, a past tense verb in the original statement in English is shifted to further in the past when the verb of speaking is put in the past.

#### Examples

- αὕτη λέγει ὅτι ὁ Ἐρατοσθένης ταῦτα ἔπραττεν. 
‘This woman says that Eratosthenes was doing these things.’

- αὕτη εἶπεν ὅτι ὁ Ἐρατοσθένης ταῦτα ἔπραττεν.
‘This woman said that Eratosthenes had been doing these things.’

If the verb of speaking is in a secondary tense (imperfect, aorist, pluperfect), the mood of the verb(s) in the indirect statement is/are often changed from the indicative to the optative of the same tense. Since there is no imperfect optative, the present optative is used to replace an imperfect indicative. The translation into English remains the same.

- αὕτη εἶπεν ὅτι ὁ Ἐρατοσθένης ταῦτα πράττοι.
‘This woman said that Eratosthenes had been doing these things.’
