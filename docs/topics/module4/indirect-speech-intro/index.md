## Indirect speech: introduction


Indirect speech (also called ‘indirect statement’ or ‘indirect discourse’) is a way of representing some kind of verbal activity — speaking, asking, thinking, hearing, any representation of words in speech or thought. We began learning the construction of indirect speech in ancient Greek as a subordinate clause introduced by ὅτι or ὡς, which is similar to the English use of a subordinate clause introduced by "that." In this module we will review that construction and add two other ways ancient Greek can form indirect speech: by using an infinitive or by using a participle. Which construction is used depends on the type of verb introducing the indirect speech and on idiom, which also means that native speakers/writers may change these up. Some verbs may allow two or even all three of these possible constructions, so the rules of which verbs introduce which construction are not hard and fast.
