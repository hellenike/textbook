## Additional Third-Declension Noun Patterns
Two very common nouns in ancient Greek are the words ἀνήρ, ἀνδρός, ὁ (‘man, husband’) and πόλις, πολέως, ἡ (‘city-state, polis’), both belonging to the third declension. Learn their declensions and accent patterns.

| **Case** | **ἀνήρ, ἀνδρός, ὁ** | **πόλις, πόλεως, ἡ** | 
|------|------|------|
| **Nominative sing.** |  ἀνήρ    |   πόλις   |     
| **Genitive** |   ἀνδρός   |   πόλεως   |   
| **Dative** |   ἀνδρί   |   πόλει   |   
| **Accusative** |   ἄνδρα   |  πόλιν    |  
| **** |      |      |    
| **Nominative	pl.** |  ἄνδρες    |  πόλεις    |   
| **Genitive** | ἀνδρῶν     |  πόλεων    | 
| **Dative** |  ἀνδράσι    |   πόλεσι   |    
| **Accusative** |  ἄνδρας    |   πόλεις   |   


### Notes on forms
Declined in a manner similar to ἀνήρ, ἀνδρός, ὁ are the common nouns πατήρ, πατρός, ὁ (‘father, ancestor’), μήτηρ, μητρός, ἡ (‘mother’), and θυγάτηρ, θυγατρός, ἡ (‘daughter’). 

What is happening with the accent in the genitive singular and genitive plural of πόλις? An earlier form of the genitive singular was πόληος, which underwent “quantitative metathesis” of its vowels, but the accent remained where it was. The genitive plural just copied that (“assimilation”).
