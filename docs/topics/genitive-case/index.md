## The genitive case  



The **genitive case** is used to relate one noun to another. (In fact, this is a feature of 
*all* the languages in the Indo-European family.)
While you may often find that  nouns in the genitive case are translated with the English preposition "of," it is important to understand the range of underlying ideas expressed by the genitive in ancient Greek.

### Some general uses of the genitive

- *Possession*: the genitive case represents the possessor of the other noun. In these instances, it might be translated into English with the preposition "of" or with the possessive marker "'s". Example: ἡ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς οἰκία "the house of the man" or "the man's house." Possessive genitives are usually placed in attributive position. 
- *Partitive genitive* or *Genitive of the whole*: the genitive expresses a group or a "whole" and the noun it is modifying is part of or one among that group. Example: ἡ βελτίστη γυνὴ πασῶν "the best wife of all." The partitive genitive is generally in the predicate position.
- *Subjective genitive* or *objective genitive*: when a noun is related to a verb, the genitive can express either the subject or the object of that verbal idea. Understanding the difference between them, even if the same phrasing is used to express each, allows for greater clarity. For example, in the English phrase "the fear of the Athenians," are the Athenians the ones fearing (subjective genitive) or the ones bring feared by someone else (objective genitive)? You would have to tell from context, and you can see that it does make a difference in meaning.
  - Subjective genitives, when the genitive is the "doer" of the implied action of the other noun, is usually in attributive position. Example: ἡ τοῦ παιδίου βοά "the cry of the baby" or "the baby's cry"
  - Objective genitives, when the genitive represents the object of the implied action, is usually in the predicate position. Example: πάντων τῶν κακῶν ἡ αἰτία "the cause of all my problems"

Other uses of the genitive we will meet later in this module, when the genitive is used with prepositions:
- *Motion away* or *separation*
- *Agent* of passive verbs
