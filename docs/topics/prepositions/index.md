## Prepositions
Preposition is a part of speech, like noun or verb or adjective, in both English and ancient Greek. A preposition and a noun create a prepositional phrase. That prepositional phrase may act adjectivally to modify a noun or adverbially to modify a predicate. Compare the uses of the prepositional phrase "on the beach" in these two English sentences:

> The women on the beach were playing. (describes which women, adjectival)

> The women were playing on the beach. (describes where they were playing, adverbial)

The nouns in a prepositional phrase in ancient Greek will be one of the oblique cases: genitive, dative, and accusative. We have already learned that noun cases in Greek have particular functions. These functions broadly determine which of the cases will be the object of a particular preposition. For example, the genitive conveys motion away from, the dative is used for a stationary position, and the accusative for motion toward or into. That relationship of case and function is apparent also with some prepositions that take more than one case of noun: which case is used shades the meaning of the preposition, sometimes subtly, sometimes substantially. 

Therefore, it is important as you learn prepositions as vocabulary that you also learn which case(s) of noun each takes as its object, and how the case of the object affects the meaning of the preposition. Preposition usage in English is highly idiomatic, and so the practice of translation requires, as always, a good understanding of what the Greek is expressing and how English expresses that same idea, rather than a single equivalence of word to word.

### Compound Verbs
The adverbial properties of prepositions can also be seen in compound verbs, in which a preposition is a prefix on a verb and shades its meaning according. For example, ἔρχομαι 'to go' --> εἰσέρχομαι 'to go into, enter' 

### Agent: a use of the preposition ὑπό + genitive
