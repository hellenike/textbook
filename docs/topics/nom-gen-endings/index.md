## Nominative and genitive case endings

The following tables summarize the nominative and genitive endings for the three Greek noun declensions, with an example of each.

### First declension


Endings for feminine first-declension nouns that end in -η / -ης. **Example**: γνώμη, γνώμης, ἡ “judgment, opinion”
 
| Case | Singular | Plural |

| Nominative | -η | -αι |
| Genitive | -ης | -ῶν |

| Nominative | -ᾰ | -αι |

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | θεράπαιν**α** | θεράπαιν**αι** |
| Genitive | θεραπαίν**ης** | θεραπαιν**ῶν** |



Endings for masculine first-declension nouns that end in -ης.    **Example**:  πολίτης, πολίτου, ὁ “citizen” (the iota is long).


| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ης / -ᾱς | -αι |
| Genitive | -ου | -ῶν |

#### Notes on the first declension


- The first declension has one important exception to the expected position of the accent:  the genitive plural ending of the first declension is *always* accented with a circumflex! (There is a historical reason for this apparent exception, which has to do with the linguistic development of these forms over time: the circumflex reflects a vowel contraction similar to those you have seen in contract verbs.)
- Note that while the vowel of the feminine singular forms varies between eta and alpha, the plural endings are *always* the same.



#### Second declension

Endings for masculine or feminine second-declension nouns that end in -ος

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ος | -οι |
| Genitive | -ου | -ων |

For neuter second-declension nouns that end in -ον

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ον | -ᾰ |
| Genitive | -ου | -ων |


#### Third declension

The third declension also contains nouns of all three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. The third declension is sometimes called the "consonant declension" because most nouns in this declension have stems ending in a consonant. Because of linguistic changes to different kinds of stems, a variety of patterns exists that you will need to become familiar with over time. Here we introduce just the basic pattern of endings that signify the third declension.

For masculine or feminine third-declension nouns:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ς or no ending | -ες  |
| Genitive | -ος  | -ων |

> Note that the *genitive* singular ending in this declension, -ος, is the same as the masculine or feminine ending of the *nominative* singular form in the second declension. That shows us that knowing what declension a noun belongs to, as well as what gender it is, is crucial for knowing what form the ending is indicating. 

For neuter third-declension nouns:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | - | -ᾰ |
| Genitive | -ος | -ων |

> Compare also the neuter nominative plural ending in both the second and third declensions, -ᾰ, and one of the feminine nominative singular forms in the first declension, also -ᾰ.
