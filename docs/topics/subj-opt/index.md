## The Optative Mood: Overview

You were introduced to the indicative mood in Module 1. In this module, you will learn how to form verbs in the optative mood. The Greek name for the mood is εὐκτική, "expressing a wish," which was one of the functions of the optative when it was used as the main verb of a sentence. Verbs in the optative mood are used both in subordinate clauses (we will learn a few of them in this module) and in certain independent clauses (which you will learn about next semester).

You will recall that ancient Greek verbs have four moods: 
1. the indicative mood (which we have been working with) that is used to make factual statements; 
2. the imperative mood, used to give commands, which we will meet next semester, and 
3. and 4. the subjunctive and optative moods, which are used for potential or possible action in a variety of expressions. In some types of subordinate clauses, the verb would be in the subjunctive or the optative mood depending on whether the main clause is in a primary (present/future/perfect) or secondary tense (imperfect/aorist/pluperfect). Since we have been working with indicative verbs only in the secondary tenses of the imperfect and aorist, we will introduce the optative mood first.

### Important things to know about the optative:

- The meaning of the optative mood and therefore the way we translate an optative verb form is entirely dependent on its context, its use in that particular clause. You must always first identify the type of "verbal chunk" they belong to. Therefore, we will not give translations to optative forms in the explanation of how to form them.
- The "tense" of a verb in the optative mood represents the *aspect* of the action, not the *time*. A present optative expresses ongoing or continuous action, not necessarily action in the present time. An aorist optative expresses a single action, not necessarily action in the past.
- Forming these verbs requires adding a new set of endings onto the same principal part stems that you have already learned.

### Forming the present optative of thematic (and non-contracted) verbs and athematic verbs like δείκνυμι

- (1) start by removing the first person singular ending (-ω or -ομαι / -μι or -μαι) and accent from the first principal part 

> κελεύω -> κελευ-
>  
> δείκνυμι  -> δεικνυ-


- (2) Add the appropriate ending. For this module, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural.  Note that in all person-number combinations of the present optative, the middle and passive have identical endings.

| Number  | Active  | Middle/Passive  |
|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -οι   | -οιτο   |
| 3rd plural  | -οιεν   | -οιντο   |


- (3) Apply recessive accent. Note that the final -οι in the optative form counts as *long* for accentuation (in contrast to the final -οι in the second declension masculine or feminine nominative plural, which counts as short for purposes of accentuation).

**Example of κελεύω "command"**

| Person and Number | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  κελεύοι   | κελεύοιτο  | κελεύοιτο |
| 3rd plural | κελεύοιεν | κελεύοιντο  | κελεύοιντο  |


### Forming the aorist optative of thematic verbs and athematic verbs like δείκνυμι

Just as you learned to do for the aorist indicative active and middle, for the aorist optative active and middle you will use the third principal part. 

For the aorist optative passive, you will use the sixth principal part, as you did for the aorist passive indicative. 

As with the indicative, you will only distinguish between "first" and "second" aorists with the third principal part and the forms created from it. A reminder: you can recognize a first aorist by a third principal ending in -α or -άμην. Verbs that have a second aorist have a third principal part that ends in -ον or -όμην.

Recall that principal parts are all 1st person indicative mood verb forms. The third and sixth principal parts, as aorist indicative forms, carry the augment that is one indication of a past tense in the indicative. Optative forms *never* carry an augment, so in forming aorist optative verb forms, you must **remove the augment** from the principal part. When the augment is an epsilon that has been added as a prefix, it is simple to remove it. When the augment is a lengthening of a vowel that begins the stem, you can often look to the first principal part to see what the unaugmented form is. Irregular verbs will, as we have come to expect, offer more variety between first and third prinicpal parts stems, and so we need to use more caution in thinking about what the unaugmented stem will be.

**First aorist optative**

- (1a) for the active and middle, start by removing the first person singular ending (-α or -άμην), augment, and accent from the third principal part:

> ἐκέλευσα  -> κελευσ-
>  
> ἔδειξα  -> δειξ-
> 
> ἡγησάμην -> ἡγησ- (compare the first prinicpal part ἡγέομαι, which also begins with an eta) 

- (1b) for the aorist passive, start by removing the first person singular ending (-ην), augment, and accent from the sixth principal part:

> ἐκελεύσθην -> κελευσθ-
> 
> ἐδείχθην -> δειχθ-

- (2) Add the appropriate ending. For this module, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural. Note that there are two possible endings in both active forms and in the third person plural passive forms. 


|   | Active  | Middle  | Passive  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -αι or -ειε(ν)  | -αιτο   | -είη  |
|  3rd plural | -αιεν or -ειαν   | -αιντο   | -είησαν or -εῖεν  |

- (3) Apply recessive accent. Note that the final -αι in the optative form counts as *long* for accentuation (in contrast to the final -αι in the first declension feminine or masculine nominative plural, which counts as short for purposes of accentuation).

**Example of first aorist optative from δείκνυμι "show"**

| Person and Number | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular | δείξαι or δείξειε(ν)    | δείξαιτο   | δειχθείη  |
| 3rd plural | δείξαιεν or δείξειαν  | δείξαιντο   | δειχθείησαν or δειχθεῖεν   |



**Second aorist optative**

- (1a) for the active and middle, start by removing the first person singular ending (-ον or -όμην), augment, and accent from the third principal part:

> ἔβαλον  -> βαλ-
>  
> ἦλθον  -> ἐλθ-
> 
> ἐγενόμην -> γεν- 

- (1b) for the aorist passive, start by removing the first person singular ending (-ην), augment, and accent from the sixth principal part:

> ἐβλήθην -> βλήθ-


- (2) Add the appropriate ending. For this module, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural. Note that the second aorist active and middle endings are the same as those of the present active and middle optative. Therefore, it is the difference in the *stem* that will indicate that these are aorist forms. (Recall that we had to notice the same difference with the second aorist indicative compared to the imperfect indicative in the active and middle voices.)

|   | Active  | Middle  | Passive  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -οι   | -οιτο   | -είη   |
|  3rd plural | -οιεν  | -οιντο   | -είησαν or -εῖεν  |

- (3) Apply recessive accent. This final -οι in the optative form counts as *long* for accentuation, as it did in the present endings.

**Example of second aorist optative from βάλλω "throw"**

| Person and Number | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular | βάλοι    | βάλοιτο   | βληθείη  |
| 3rd plural | βάλοιεν  | βάλοιντο   | βληθείησαν or βληθεῖεν  |
