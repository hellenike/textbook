## Overview

You were introduced to the indicative mood in Module 1. In this module, you will learn how to form verbs in the subjunctive and optative moods. Verbs in these moods appear frequently in subordinate clauses (such as the purpose clause, in this module) and in certain independent clauses (which you will learn about next semester).

Learning to form subjunctive and optative verbs will open up whole worlds of expression — possibilities, conditions, wishes, mental content of all sorts.

### Important things to know:

- The way we translate subjunctives and optatives is entirely dependent on their context. You must always first identify the type of "verbal chunk" they belong to.
- Forming these verbs requires only adding a new set of endings onto the same principal part stems that you have already learned.

### Forming the present subjunctive and optative

**Present subjunctive**

To the stem from the first principal part, add the following endings:

| Number  | Active  | Middle/Passive  |
|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -ῃ  | -ηται  |
| 3rd plural  | -ωσι(ν)  | -ωνται |


**Present optative**
| Number  | Active  | Middle/Passive  |
|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  |   |   |
| 3rd plural  |   |   |

### Forming the aorist subjunctive and optative

As you would expect, for the active and middle, add endings to the stem from the third principal part. For the passive, add endings to the stem from the sixth principal part. Subjunctive and optative forms never carry an augment, however, so you must remove the augment from the stem.

**Aorist subjunctive**

|   | Active  | Middle  | Passive  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -ῃ   | -ηται  | -ῇ  |
|  3rd plural | -ωσι(ν)| -ωνται | -ῶσι(ν)  |

**Aorist optative**

|   | Active  | Middle  | Passive  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  |   |   |   |
|  3rd plural |   |   |   |
