## The Optative Mood: Overview

You were introduced to the indicative mood in Module 1. In this module, you will learn how to form verbs in the optative moods. Verbs in the optative mood appear both in subordinate clauses (such as the purpose clause, which we will learn in this module) and in certain independent clauses (which you will learn about next semester).

You will recall that ancient Greek verbs have four moods: the indicative mood (which we have been working with) that is used to make factual statements; the imperative mood, used to give commands, which we will meet next semester, and the subjunctive and optative moods, which are used for potential or possible action in a variety of expressions. In some types of subordinate clauses, the verb would be in the subjunctive or the optative mood depending on whether the main clause is in a primary (present/future/perfect) or secondary tense (imperfect/aorist/pluperfect). Since we have been working with indicative verbs only in the secondary tenses of the imperfect and aorist, we will introduce the optative mood first.

### Important things to know:

- The way we translate an optative verb form is entirely dependent on its context, its use in that particular clause. You must always first identify the type of "verbal chunk" they belong to. 
- The "tense" of a verb in these moods represents the *aspect* of the action, not the *time*. Thus a present optative expresses ongoing or continuous action, and an aorist optative expresses a single action.
- Forming these verbs requires only adding a new set of endings onto the same principal part stems that you have already learned.

### Forming the present optative

To the stem from the first principal part, add the following endings:

| Number  | Active  | Middle/Passive  |
|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -οι   | -οιτο   |
| 3rd plural  | -οιεν   | -οιντο   |

### Forming the aorist optative

As you would expect, for the active and middle, add endings to the stem from the third principal part. For the passive, add endings to the stem from the sixth principal part. As with the indicative, since a different prinicpal part (the sixth) is used for the passive 

Optative forms never carry an augment, however, so you must remove the augment from the stem.


**1st Aorist optative**

|   | Active  | Middle  | Passive  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -αι or -ειε(ν)  | -αιτο   | -είη  |
|  3rd plural | -αιεν or -ειαν   | -αιντο   | -είησαν or -εῖεν  |


**2nd Aorist optative**

|   | Active  | Middle  | Passive  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -οι   | -οιτο   | -είη   |
|  3rd plural | -οιεν  | -οιντο   | -είησαν or -εῖεν  |
