## The Subjunctive and Optative Moods: Overview

You were introduced to the indicative mood in Module 1. In this module, you will learn how to form verbs in the subjunctive and optative moods. Verbs in these moods appear frequently in subordinate clauses (such as the purpose clause, in this module) and in certain independent clauses (which you will learn about next semester).

Learning to form subjunctive and optative verbs will open up whole worlds of expression — possibilities, conditions, wishes, mental content of all sorts.

### Important things to know:

- The way we translate subjunctives and optatives is entirely dependent on their context. You must always first identify the type of "verbal chunk" they belong to. The "tense" of a verb in these moods represents the *aspect* of the action, not the *time*. Thus a present subjunctive or optative expresses ongoing or continuous action, and an aorist subjunctive or optative expresses a single action.
- Forming these verbs requires only adding a new set of endings onto the same principal part stems that you have already learned.

### Forming the present subjunctive and optative

**Present subjunctive**

To the stem from the first principal part, add the following endings:

| Number | Active | Middle/Passive |
|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -ῃ  | -ηται  |
| 3rd plural  | -ωσι(ν)  | -ωνται |


**Present optative**

| Number  | Active  | Middle/Passive  |
|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -οι   | -οιτο   |
| 3rd plural  | -οιεν   | -οιντο   |

### Forming the aorist subjunctive and optative

As you would expect, for the active and middle, add endings to the stem from the third principal part. For the passive, add endings to the stem from the sixth principal part. Subjunctive and optative forms never carry an augment, however, so you must remove the augment from the stem.

Examples:

**Aorist subjunctive**

|   | Active  | Middle  | Passive  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -ῃ   | -ηται  | -ῇ  |
|  3rd plural | -ωσι(ν)| -ωνται | -ῶσι(ν)  |

**1st Aorist optative**

|   | Active  | Middle  | Passive  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -αι or -ειε(ν)  | -αιτο   | -είη  |
|  3rd plural | -αιεν or -ειαν   | -αιντο   | -είησαν or -εῖεν  |


**2nd Aorist optative**

|   | Active  | Middle  | Passive  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -οι   | -οιτο   | -είη   |
|  3rd plural | -οιεν  | -οιντο   | -είησαν or -εῖεν  |
