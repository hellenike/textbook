# The second aorist

A small group of verbs use a different set of endings to form the active and middle voices of the aorist indicative.  Their endings are identical to the endings of the imperfect indicative, but applied to the third stem.

- easily recognized from third principal part.  Examples: ἦλθον, εἶπον, ἐγενόμην

Contrast:

ἔλεγε - εἶπε, ἤρχετο - ἦλθε

Note principal part ἔρχομαι shows us that there is no active voice in the first principal part ("present system"), while ἦλθον shows us that the aorist indicative appears in the active voice using second aorist endings.
