## The second aorist

A small group of verbs use a different set of endings to form the *active* and *middle* voices of the aorist indicative.  You will be happy to learn that these second aorist endings are actually identical to the endings you have already learned for the imperfect active and middle of -ω verbs.  We recognize that a verb has a "second aorist" set of endings for the aorist active and middle when the third principal part ends in -ον or -όμην.  

Examples: ἦλθον (from ἔρχομαι), εἶπον (from λέγω), ἐγενόμην (from γίγνομαι).


#### Active and middle of second aorist -ω verbs

Formation follows the same process as first aorist active and middle forms.

- (1) principal parts give an example form in the first singular indicative active of a representative tense: start by dropping the first singular ending -ον or -όμην and remove the accent from the third principal part:

> ἦλθον -> ἠλθ-
>
> εἶπον -> εἰπ-
> 
> ἐγενόμην -> ἐγεν-

- (2) Add the appropriate ending.  In this module, you should memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural.

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  -ε | -ετο |
| 3rd plural | -ον | -οντο |

Notice that these endings are identical to the endings of the imperfect indicative. You will distinguish the imperfect from the aorist for these verbs by noticing which verb stem (which principal part) the ending is applied to. In the imperfect the ending is applied to the first principal part stem, and in the aorist the ending is applied to the third stem. Examples: ἤρχετο (imperfect) "She was going" vs. ἦλθε (aorist) "She went"; ἔλεγε "She was saying"  vs. εἶπε "She said."

Note that the first person singular active ending in the second aorist -ον is the same as that of the third personal plural active.


- (3) Apply recessive accent.  


#### Examples

| | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἦλθε | ἤλθετο | no 6th principal part |
| 3rd plural | ἦλθον | ἤλθοντο | no 6th principal part  |

Note that the first principal part ἔρχομαι shows us that there is no active voice for the forms made from that principal part ("present system"), while ἦλθον shows us that the aorist indicative appears in the active voice using second aorist endings.

| | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  εἶπε | εἴπετο | ἐλέχθη |
| 3rd plural | εἶπον | εἴποντο  |ἐλέχθησαν  |

Since the aorist passive is formed from the sixth principal part, those forms follow the same formation regardless of whether the third principal part is a first aorist or second aorist.

#### Practice

Recall that the first, third and sixth principal parts of the verb "throw, hit (by throwing), strike (by throwing)" are βάλλω, ἔβαλον and ἐβλήθην.

Compose the correct Greek form for the highlighted verb in the following English phrases, and fully identify the form (person, number, tense, mood, voice).

1. She *used to throw* the dice.
2. He *hit* Pandorus with a spear.
3. He *was struck* by the weapon.
4. They "*were throwing (for themselves)* their cloaks around their shoulders".  (a Greek idiom for putting on a garment)
