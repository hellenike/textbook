## The second aorist

A small group of verbs use a different set of endings to form the active and middle voices of the aorist indicative. We recognize a verb has a "second aorist" set of endings for the aorist active and middle when the third principal part ends in -ον or -όμην.  Examples: ἦλθον (from ἔρχομαι), εἶπον (from λέγω), ἐγενόμην (from γίγνομαι).

#### Active and middle of second aorist  -ω verbs

Formation follows the same process as first aorist active and middle forms.
- (1) principal parts give an example form in the first singular indicative active of a representative tense: start by dropping the first singular ending -ον or -όμην and the accent from the third principal part:

> ἦλθον -> ἠλθ-
>
> εἶπον -> εἰπ-
> 
> ἐγενόμην -> ἐγεν-

- (2) Add appropriate ending.  For today, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural.

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  -ε | -ετο |
| 3rd plural | -ον | -οντο |

Notice that these endings are identical to the endings of the imperfect indicative. You will distinguish the imperfect from the aorist for these verbs by noticing which verb stem (which principal part) the ending is applied to. In the imperfect the ending is applied to the first principal part stem, and in the aorist the ending is applied to the third stem. Examples: ἤρχετο "She was going" vs. ἦλθε "She went"; ἔλεγε "She was saying"  - εἶπε "She said."

Note that the 1st person singular active ending in the second aorist -ον is the same as that of the 3rd personal plural active.


- (3) Apply recessive accent.  


#### Examples

| | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἦλθε | ἤλθετο | no 6th prinicpal part |
| 3rd plural | ἦλθον | ἤλθοντο | no 6th principal part  |

Note that the first principal part ἔρχομαι shows us that there is no active voice for the forms made from that principal part ("present system"), while ἦλθον shows us that the aorist indicative appears in the active voice using second aorist endings.

| | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  εἶπε | εἴπετο | ἐλέχθη |
| 3rd plural | εἶπον | εἴποντο  |ἐλέχθησαν  |
