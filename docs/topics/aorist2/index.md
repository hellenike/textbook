## The second aorist

A small group of verbs use a different set of endings to form the active and middle voices of the aorist indicative. We recognize a verb has a "second aorist" set of endings for the aorist active and middle when the third principal part ends in -ον or -όμην.

#### Active and middle of second aorist verbs

Formation follows the same process as first aorist active and middle forms, and 
- (1) principal parts give an example form in the first singular indicative active of a representative tense: start by dropping the first singular ending -ον or -όμην and the accent from the third principal part:

> ἦλθον -> ἠλθ-
>
> εἶπον -> εἰπ-
> 
> ἐγενόμην -> ἐγεν-

- (2) Add appropriate ending.  For today, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural.

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  -ε | -ετο |
| 3rd plural | -ον | -οντο |

Notice that these endings are identical to the endings of the imperfect indicative. But , but applied to the third stem.

- easily recognized from third principal part.  Examples: ἦλθον, εἶπον, ἐγενόμην

Contrast:

ἔλεγε - εἶπε, ἤρχετο - ἦλθε

Note principal part ἔρχομαι shows us that there is no active voice in the first principal part ("present system"), while ἦλθον shows us that the aorist indicative appears in the active voice using second aorist endings.

Note that the 1st person singular active ending in the second aorist -ον is the same as that of the 3rd personal plural active.
