## The Definite Article and Pronouns

The definite article is used so frequently in ancient Greek that it must and will become familiar, with its uses and nuances grasped with practice. Pronouns are also frequrntly used, and come in different types and uses that we will start, but not cover exhaustively, in this section.

### The definite article

English has a definite article, "the" and an indefinite article, "a" or "an." Ancient Greek has only the definite article, and its uses are both straightforward and subtle.

#### Forms of the definite article
The article modifying a noun agrees with it in gender, case, and number. There is a full paradigm of forms with all three genders in all cases and numbers, and it is important to learn to recognize these forms easily.

### Pronouns

Pronouns are a part of speech, words that are used in place of and in reference to a noun. There are several types of pronouns in ancient Greek, as there are in English: personal, relative, demonstrative, interrogative, indefinite, reflexive, reciprocal, intensive, and more. We know and use all of these types of pronouns without perhaps knowing their classification. In this section, we will learn the ancient Greek personal pronouns, the relative pronoun, and demonstrative pronouns.
