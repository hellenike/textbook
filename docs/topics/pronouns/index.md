## Pronouns

Pronoun is a part of speech. Pronouns are used in place of and in reference to a noun. Like nouns, pronouns in ancient Greek have grammatical gender, case, and number; the case of a pronoun, like that of a noun, will tell you its function in a clause.

There are several types of pronouns in ancient Greek, as there are in English: personal, relative, demonstrative, interrogative, indefinite, reflexive, reciprocal, intensive, and more. We know and use all of these types of pronouns without perhaps knowing their classification. In this section, we will learn the ancient Greek personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, and the relative pronoun.

### Personal pronouns

The designation "personal" for personal pronouns is connected to the idea of "person" as a feature of verbs: that is, first person, second, person, and third person just as we use those terms for verbs. Thus for these pronouns, gender and number have a relationship with person. First person ("I" in the singular and "we" in the plural) and second person ("you") personal pronouns are understood to have grammatical gender corresponding to embodied gender of the person or persons they are referring to. Third person pronouns ("he, she, it" in singular, "they" in plural) in ancient Greek have different forms in the singular of grammatical gender depending on the gender (grammatical or embodied) of the person or thing referred to. That is, grammatical gender of nouns will be reflected in the grammatical gender of the pronoun that refers to it.

Pronouns are among the words in English that still have cases. We have a "subjective" case of pronouns that is like the nominative: I, we, he, she. The "objective" case of pronouns are used for objects of verbs or objects of prepositions, and so that is what we will use for the "oblique" cases (a category covering the genitive, dative, and accusative cases) in ancient Greek: me, us, him, her, them. In English, we no longer have distinctions for the second person in cases, just as with number: "you" is used in all cases and numbers, and "it" is also used for both the subjective and objective cases.

| Case | 1st person | English equivalent | 2nd person | English equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   | **singular** |   | **singular** |  |
| nominative | ἐγώ | I | σύ | you |
| genitive | μου / ἐμοῦ | (of) me | σου / σοῦ | (of) you |
| dative | μοι / ἐμοί  | (to/for) me | σοι / σοί | (to/for) you |
| accusative | με / ἐμέ | me | σε / σέ | you |
|   | **plural** |   | **plural** |   |
| nominative | ἡμεῖς  | we | ὑμεῖς  | you |
| genitive | ἡμῶν | (of) us | ὑμῶν | (of) you |
| dative | ἡμῖν | (to/for) us | ὑμῖν | (to/for) you |
| accusative | ἡμᾶς  | us | ὑμᾶς  | you |

We have already seen in studying person with verb forms that ancient Greek verbs do not require a separate pronoun to express the subject. Because they are not needed, nominative personal pronouns are not used to express the subject unless the speaker wants to place special emphasis. The English equivalent of using the nominative pronoun would be heavy intonation and perhaps even pointing when spoken, or underlining or italics in writing. "**_We_** are studying Greek."
