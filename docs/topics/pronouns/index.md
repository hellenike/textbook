## Pronouns (ἡ ἀντωνυμία)

"Pronoun" is a part of speech. Pronouns are used in place of and in reference to a noun: the Greek name ἀντωνυμία means "in place of a noun." The noun that a pronoun replaces and refers to is called the pronoun's _antecedent_.

Like nouns, pronouns in ancient Greek have grammatical gender, case, and number. The case of a pronoun, like that of a noun, will tell you its function in a clause.

There are several types of pronouns in ancient Greek, as there are in English: personal, demonstrative, relative, interrogative, indefinite, reflexive, and reciprocal. We know and use all of these types of pronouns without perhaps knowing their classification. In this section, we will learn the ancient Greek personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, and the relative pronoun.

### Personal pronouns

The designation "personal" for personal pronouns is connected to the idea of "person" as a feature of verbs: that is, first person, second, person, and third person just as we use those terms for verbs. Thus for these pronouns, gender and number have a relationship with person. First person ("I" in the singular and "we" in the plural) and second person ("you") personal pronouns are understood to have grammatical gender corresponding to embodied gender of the person or persons they are referring to. Third person pronouns ("he, she, it" in singular, "they" in plural) in ancient Greek have different forms in the singular of grammatical gender depending on the gender (grammatical or embodied) of the person or thing referred to. That is, grammatical gender of nouns will be reflected in the grammatical gender of the pronoun that refers to it.

Pronouns are among the words in English that still have cases. We have a "subjective" case of pronouns that is like the nominative: I, we, he, she. The "objective" case of pronouns are used for objects of verbs or objects of prepositions, and so that is what we will use for the "oblique" cases (a category covering the genitive, dative, and accusative cases) in ancient Greek: me, us, him, her, them. In English, we no longer have distinctions for the second person in cases, just as with number: "you" is used in all cases and numbers, and "it" is also used for both the subjective and objective cases.

| Case | 1st person | English equivalent | 2nd person | English equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   | **singular** |   | **singular** |  |
| nominative | ἐγώ | I | σύ | you |
| genitive | μου / ἐμοῦ | (of) me | σου / σοῦ | (of) you |
| dative | μοι / ἐμοί  | (to/for) me | σοι / σοί | (to/for) you |
| accusative | με / ἐμέ | me | σε / σέ | you |
|   | **plural** |   | **plural** |   |
| nominative | ἡμεῖς  | we | ὑμεῖς  | you |
| genitive | ἡμῶν | (of) us | ὑμῶν | (of) you |
| dative | ἡμῖν | (to/for) us | ὑμῖν | (to/for) you |
| accusative | ἡμᾶς  | us | ὑμᾶς  | you |

We have already seen in studying person with verb forms that ancient Greek verbs do not require a separate pronoun to express the subject. Because they are not needed, nominative personal pronouns are not used to express the subject unless the speaker wants to place special emphasis on that subject. The English equivalent of using the nominative pronoun would be heavy stress and perhaps even pointing when spoken, or underlining or italics in writing, such as "**_We_** are studying Greek."

The singular of the first and second person pronouns also have emphatic and unemphatic forms that operate in a similar way. The first form listed above is unemphatic. If the speaker wants to emphasize **_me_** or **_you_** in the sentence, then the second form will be used. In the first person singular, note that the emphatic form involves both an extra letter/syllable and an accent, while in the second person singular the difference is indicted solely by the accent. The unemphatic forms of both the first and second person singular pronouns are listed without an accent. They belong to a class of words called **enclitics**. (See next section.)

### Demonstrative adjectives and pronouns

The label "demonstrative" signifies that these words "point" to their referent. They may act as adjectives, modifying an expressed noun, or they may be used on their own, acting as a pronoun. English has two commonly used demonstratives: "this" and "that," which can also be used as adjectives modifying a noun (this woman, that house) or on their own as pronouns. Ancient Greek has three demonstrative adjectives/pronouns, and it is important to understand the conceptual meaning of each one.

**ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε** ("this") is used to point to something present and visible or immediate, similar to colloquial English using "this here" to describe someone or something. Conceptually it is a "first person" demonstrative, meaning that the speaker is involved with what is being pointed at. Within a text or narrative, ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε points _forward_ to what comes next, making it similar in such a context to a phrase like "the following" in English.

**οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο** ("this" or "that") is conceptually between the closeness of ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε and the distance of ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο and is "second person" (closer to the addressee than the speaker). In contrast to ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε in narrative or text, οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο looks _back_ and so points to "the preceding." It points to something closer in text than ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο, and so means "the latter" in contrast to "the former" (for which ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο would be used).

**ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο** ("that") is conceptually pointing further away than the other two demonstratives, as in a "third person" idea. The use of ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο may have an intentionally distancing effect, as "that" can in English ("I would never do _that_!")

When functioning as adjectives, demonstratives are used in ancient Greek along with the article and in predicate position. Examples:
- ἥδε ἡ ἡμέρα  "this day" (meaning "this very day, this day now, today")
- τούτον τὸν ἄνδρα "this/that man"
- τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἐκείνοις "to/for those people"

(Since English does not use its article along with demonstratives, we do not translate the article in these constructions. Leaving the article out of the translation is necessary to be idiomatic in English. That is another example of how translation is not a "one-to-one" substitution of words.)

When used as pronouns, the demonstratives are used on their own. They receive their gender and case from their _antecedent_, the noun they refer back to, but the case expresses the use of the pronoun in its own clause. If the antecedent is implied or understood, rather than expressed, we understand a noun that matches the gender and number of the demonstrative pronoun: ἐκεῖνος "that man" (masculine and singular), ταῦτα "these things" (neuter and plural), τῆσδε "of this (here) woman" (feminine and singular).

#### Declensions of demonstrative pronouns

**Declension of ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε**

| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem | Neut | Masc | Fem | Neut |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Nominative | ὅδε | ἥδε | τόδε | οἵδε | αἵδε | τάδε |
| Genitive | τοῦδε | τῆσδε | τοῦδε | τῶνδε | τῶνδε | τῶνδε |
| Dative | τῷδε | τῇδε | τῷδε | τοῖσδε | ταῖσδε | τοῖσδε |
| Accusative | τόνδε | τήνδε | τόδε | τούσδε | τάσδε | τάδε |

> Notes on the forms of ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε:
- ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε is the article + the enclitic particle -δε. The enclitic nature of -δε accounts for the accents appearing on the masculine and feminine nominative forms (while the article forms are proclitics) and for the accents remaining what they are on the article on forms like τήνδε, τούσδε, and τάσδε, which seem to be "breaking" the rule about circumflex accents on a long penult when the ultima is short. 

**Declension of οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο**

| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem | Neut | Masc | Fem | Neut |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Nominative | οὗτος | αὕτη | τοῦτο | οὗτοι | αὗται | ταῦτα |
| Genitive | τούτου | ταύτης | τούτου | τούτων | τούτων | τούτων |
| Dative | τούτῳ | ταύτῃ | τούτῳ | τούτοῖς | ταύταις | τούτοις |
| Accusative | τούτον | ταύτην | τοῦτο | τούτους | ταύτας | ταῦτα |

> Notes on the forms of οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο:
- The stem follows a pattern similar to the article, with the stem starting in tau in most forms, but with a rough breathing instead in the masculine and feminine nominative forms, both singular and plural.
- The masculine and neuter forms have second declension endings with the diphthong **ου** in the stem, while the feminine forms have first decelension endings with the diphthong **αυ** in the stem.
- The exception in the feminine is the genitive plural, which is assimilated to the same form as the masculine and neuter genitvie plural, τούτων.
- The neuter nominative and accustive plural forms use the αυ diphthong in phonetic assimilation with its ending -α.
- The neuter singular nominative and accusative are a different kind of second declension ending (-ο instead of -ον).
- The persistent accent pattern is the accent on a long penult. Thus the accent does not move from the penult, and will be a circumflex when the ultima is short and an acute when the ultima is long.

**Declension of ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο**

| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem | Neut | Masc | Fem | Neut |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Nominative | ἐκεῖνος  | ἐκείνη  | ἐκεῖνο  | ἐκεῖνοι | ἐκεῖναι  | ἐκεῖνα  |
| Genitive | ἐκείνου | ἐκείνης | ἐκείνου | ἐκείνων | ἐκείνων | ἐκείνων |
| Dative | ἐκείνῳ  | ἐκείνῃ | ἐκείνῳ | ἐκείνοις | ἐκείναις | ἐκείνοις  |
| Accusative | ἐκεῖνον | ἐκείνην | ἐκεῖνο | ἐκείνους | ἐκείνας | ἐκεῖνα |

> Notes on the forms of ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο:
- The masculine and neuter forms have second declension endings while the feminine forms have first decelension endings.
- The neuter singular nominative and accusative are a different kind of second declension ending (-ο instead of -ον).
- The persistent accent pattern is the accent on a long penult. Thus the accent does not move from the penult, and will be a circumflex when the ultima is short and an acute when the ultima is long.

### Relative pronoun

The relative pronoun is used to create dependent clauses that further describe or define a noun or pronoun in a sentence. The relative pronoun in English is _who, which,_ or _that_. Relative clauses are dependent clauses, appearing with an independent clause in a sentence. The relative clause begins with a relative pronoun, which refers to a noun or pronoun in the independent clause, its _antecedent_. Because the relative clause is modifying that noun or pronoun, the form of the relative pronoun matches the antecedent in **gender** and **number**. Because the relative clause is its own verbal unit, with its own subject and verb, the **case** of the relative pronoun is determined by its use in its own clause. 

#### Declension of ὅς, ἥ, ὅ
| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem | Neut | Masc | Fem | Neut |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Nominative | ὅς | ἥ | ὅ | οἵ | αἵ | ἅ |
| Genitive | οὗ | ἧς | οὗ | ὧν | ὧν | ὧν |
| Dative | ᾧ | ᾗ | ᾧ | οἷς | αἷς | οἷς  |
| Accusative | ὅν | ἥν | ὅ  | οὕς | ἅς | ἅ |

> Notes on the forms of ὅς, ἥ, ὅ
- the forms of the relative pronoun are similar to those of the article, without the initial tau that the article has in most forms and with a rough breathing on all forms. Note the difference in the masculine nominative singular ὅς from the article ὁ. With forms of the relative pronoun like ἥ, οἵ, and αἵ, the only difference between the article and the relative pronoun is the accent on the relative pronoun form.
- the accent pattern is also like that of the article, and like a persistent accent on the ultima: acute on nominative and accusative forms and circumflex on genitive and dative forms.

#### Examples of relative clauses

Identify the relative pronoun in the following sentences. What is its antecedent? What are the boundaries or the relative clause (where does it begin and where does it end)? What form of the relative pronoun would be used in ancient Greek (what is the gender, case, and number)?

- The woman who goes to the market brought messages to my wife.
- The house that I own has two floors.
- The husband narrated to the jurors the events which occurred.
