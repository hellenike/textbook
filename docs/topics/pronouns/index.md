## Pronouns

Pronouns are a part of speech, words that are used in place of and in reference to a noun. There are several types of pronouns in ancient Greek, as there are in English: personal, relative, demonstrative, interrogative, indefinite, reflexive, reciprocal, intensive, and more. We know and use all of these types of pronouns without perhaps knowing their classification. In this section, we will learn the ancient Greek personal pronouns, the relative pronoun, and demonstrative pronouns.
