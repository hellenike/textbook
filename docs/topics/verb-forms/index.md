## Finite Verb Forms


Finite verb forms have five properties: **person**, **number**, **tense**, **voice**, and **mood**. To properly identify a finite verb form, you must identify all five properties. Ancient Greek finite verb forms contain all of this information in the verb form itself. In English, we often need other words to convey some of this information, such as subject pronouns to convey the person and number, and auxiliary (or "helping") verbs to express tense, mood, and voice.

### Person

A verb's person expresses the subject of the verb in relation to the "speaker" of the sentence. 

1. The first person (I or we in English) subject includes the speaker. 
2. The second person (you in English) subject is the addressee(s) of the speaker. 
3. The third person (he, she, it, they in English) subject is a person or thing separate from the speaker and addressee.  


### Number

Number combines with person in describing the subject of verb. It indicates when the subject is singular or plural. In English, for example, 1st person singular is "I" while 1st person plural is "we."

Ancient Greek also has an additional, less common "number" known as the dual, when the subject is two persons, animals, body parts (e.g., eyes, hands), or things acting together.



### Tense

The tense of a finite verb describes the time of the action and/or its aspect. "Aspect" refers to the type of the action as simple/single, ongoing/repeated, or completed.

Ancient Greek has seven tenses, which are divided into "primary" and "secondary" tenses. The "secondary" tenses are all past tenses, while the "primary" tenses represent actions in the present or future.

- Primary tenses: Present, Future, Perfect, Future Perfect
- Secondary tenses: Imperfect, Aorist, Pluperfect

Multiple tenses for action in a particular "time" (such as the past) differ in terms of *aspect*. Aspect emphasizes the type of action being represented, or how the action is being depicted. Aspects include **simple**, **ongoing or continuous** and **completed**. Tense can indicate both time and aspect, or, in some verb forms, aspect alone.


### Voice

Voice expresses the relationship between the action of the verb and the subject. English has two voices: active, in which the subject is performing the action of the verb ("I love"), and passive, in which the subject is receiving the action of the verb ("I am loved").

Ancient Greek has active and passive voices that operate the same way. It also has a third voice, the middle. In the middle voice, the subject performs the action of the verb with a particular interest or reference between the subject and the action of the verb, such as reflexive ("I love myself"), reciprocal ("we love each other"), initiating the action to be performed by another ("I got my hair cut") or with a particular self-interest ("I love for my own reasons, in my own interests").

In some uses (and for some verbs in all uses), the middle forms will have a meaning that is best represented by an active verb form in English. But paying attention the the ideas that the middle form represents is important for understanding ancient Greek modes of expression. 

For some verb tenses, the middle and the passive share the same form. If you are identifying the form alone, you should identify it as "middle/passive." In a sentence, however, you will consider other syntactic structures within the clause or sentence to determine whether that particular use is middle or is passive, in order to understand the clause or sentence correctly.


### Mood
The mood of a verb indicates the function of the expression and the nature of the action in the speaker's conception. "Mood" and "mode" come from the same root in English: the "mood" of a verb is the "mode" in which the verb is operating.

Ancient Greek has four moods: (1) the indicative, used to express statement or question of a factual nature (in the eyes of the speaker) in the past, present, or future; (2) the imperative, used to give a command; (3) the subjective and (4) the optative, which have many uses in subordinate clauses and are also used to express potential or possible action or action that could have happened but did not. 


### Negation with finite verb forms

There are two basic words in ancient Greek used to negate a finite verb form: οὐ and μή. ("not")
οὐ: Indicative verbs in most clauses are negated with οὐ. Note that οὐ has a smooth breathing and no accent. If the word that follows οὐ in a sentence begins with a vowel also with a smooth breathing, οὐ becomes οὐκ. If the word following begins with a rough breathing, οὐ becomes οὐχ. 
μή: Some verbs in other moods or certain types of clauses use μή instead. We will meet μή again in Module 4.
