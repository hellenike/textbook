## Forms of the nominative and genitive cases


The case endings of nouns the singular nominative and genitive cases reflect both the noun's gender and what declension it belongs to.

#### First declension

> *Note on the persistent accent*: the first declension has one important exception to the expected position of the accent, in the genitive plural. The genitive plural ending of the first declension is always accented with a circumflex. There is a reason for this apparent exception, which has to do with the linguistic development of these forms over time: that circumflex reflects a vowel contraction similar to those you have seen in contract verbs.

Notice below that all the plural endings in this declension are the same, even with the variations in the singular.

For feminine first-declension nouns that end in -η

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -η | -αι |
| Genitive | -ης | -ῶν |

For feminine first-declension nouns that end in -ᾱ

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ᾱ | -αι |
| Genitive | -ᾱς | -ῶν |

For feminine first-declension nouns that end in -ᾰ

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ᾰ | -αι |
| Genitive | -ης | -ῶν |

For masculine first-declension nouns that end in -ης / -ᾱς

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ης / -ᾱς | -αι |
| Genitive | -ου | -ῶν |


#### Second declension

For masculine or feminine second-declension nouns that end in -ος

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ος | -οι |
| Genitive | -ου | -ων |

For neuter second-declension nouns that end in -ον

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ον | -ᾰ |
| Genitive | -ου | -ων |


#### Third declension

The third declension also contains nouns of all three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. The third declension is sometimes called the "consonant declension" because most nouns in this declension have stems ending in a consonant. Because of linguistic changes to different kinds of stems, a variety of patterns exists that you will need to become familiar with over time. Here we introduce just the basic pattern of endings that signify the third declension.

For masculine or feminine third-declension nouns:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ς or no ending | -ες  |
| Genitive | -ος  | -ων |

> Note that the *genitive* singular ending in this declension, -ος, is the same as the masculine or feminine ending of the *nominative* singular form in the second declension. That shows us that knowing what declension a noun belongs to, as well as what gender it is, is crucial for knowing what form the ending is indicating. 

For neuter third-declension nouns:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | - | -ᾰ |
| Genitive | -ος | -ων |

> Compare also the neuter nominative plural ending in both the second and third declensions, -ᾰ, and one of the feminine nominative singular forms in the first declension, also -ᾰ.
