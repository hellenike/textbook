## Generalizing conditions: present and past time


### Generalizing conditions about present or past time

| Time | Protasis | Apodosis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Past | εἰ + optative | imperfect indicative |
| Present | ἐάν (= εἰ + ἄν)  + subjunctive | present indicative |

εἰ + ἄν normally contracts to ἐάν 

Note that the form of the apodosis is equally possible in a particular statement, and 
can stand alone as a statement about repeated action: imperfect indicative for past time, present indicative for present time. 

The form of the protasis explicitly generalizes the conditional statement.

#### Introducing the subjunctive mood

- as with optative, choose present vs. aorist to express aspect.

Formation:


- endings characterized by long vowel
- endings for present and aorist subjunctive are identical
- as with all verb forms, use the first part for the present system, third and sixth parts for aorist
- the aorist passive forms are actually a contraction of the ending's long vowel with the regular stem -θε- : notice the accent!

Endings for present and aorist subjunctive :

| Person/number | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3.s | -ῃ | -ηται | -ηται |
| 3.pl | -ωσι | -ωνται | -ωνται |



Compare the formation of indicative, subjunctive and optative in present and aorist:

3.sing of the present:

| Tense + Voice | Indicative | Subjunctive | Optative |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Present Active | ἄρχ-**ει** | ἄρχ-**ῃ** | ἄρχ-**οι** |
| Present Middle | ἄρχ-**εται** | ἄρχ-**ηται** | ἄρχ-**οιτο** | 
| Present Passive | ἄρχ-**εται** | ἄρχ-**ηται** | ἄρχ-**οιτο** | 


3. sing of the aorist.  2 notes:

1. recall that only indicative forms have the augment
2. notice the accent of the aorist passive!

| Tense + Voice | Indicative | Subjunctive | Optative |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Aorist Active | ἤρξ-**ε**  | ἄρξ-**ῃ** | ἄρξ-**αι** or ἄρξ-**ειε** |
| Aorist Middle | ἤρξ-**ατο** | ἄρξ-**ηται** | ἄρξ-**αιτο** | 
| Aorist Passive | ἤρχθ-**η** | ἀρχθ-**ῇ**| ἀρχθ-**είη** |
