## The perfect system: participles

### Reviewing principal parts

So far, we have worked with the following principal parts of the Greek verb:

| First | Second | Third | Sixth | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| present and imperfect, all voices | future active and middle | aorist active and middle | future passive, aorist passive |

We will now add the final tense system, called the *perfect tense*.  It uses the fourth principal part for the active voice, and the fifth principal part for the middle and passive voices.

### Meaning


Action completed in past - but continuing force in present


### Formation

- 4th-part: active
- 5th part: middle and passive

Typical patterns of stem: *reduplication*

Active participle: -ώς, -υῖα, -ός  (3-1-3, like aor active)

Middle and passive participles:  -μένος, -μένη, μένον (2-1-2 like pres m and p). Note: *no vowel* before participle ending

Note persistent accent.
