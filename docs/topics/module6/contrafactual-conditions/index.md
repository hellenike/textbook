## Contrafactual conditions


Simple and generalizing conditional statements about past or present time both state that something is true. *Contrary to fact* or *contrafactual* statements instead assert that the protasis is *not* true; the apodosis states what *would* or *would have* occurred if the protasis been true.  Here are examples in English.

Present time: "If they thought his speech was interesting, they would pay attention".  In fact, they find his speech boring, and are not paying attention.

Past time: "If the jury thought he was innocent, they would not have convicted him." In fact, the jury though he was guilty, and they *did* convict him.

Greek makes contrafactual statements with the indicative mood, but marks them as untrue by including the particle ἄν in the apodosis. Normally, for present contrafactual conditions, the tense of both protasis and apodosis is imperfect; for past contrafactual conditions, aorist, as summarized here:

| Time | Protasis | Apodosis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Present | εἰ + imperfect indicative | imperfect indicative + ἄν |
| Past | εἰ + aorist indicative | aorist indicative  + ἄν  |


### Examples of contrafactual conditions

> εἰ μὴ ἐνόμιζoν αὐτὸν αἴτιον εἶναι, οἱ γραψάμενοι οὐκ ἂν ἐγράφοντο αὐτόν.

̣"If they did not think he was guilty, the plaintiffs would not be suing him in court." (In fact, they think he *is* guilty, and they are suing him.)


> εἰ μὴ ἐμοίχευσεν ὁ ᾿Ερατοσθένης τὴν γυναῖκα, οὐκ ἂν ἀπέκτεινε αὐτὸν ὁ Εὐφίλητος.

"If Eratosthenes had not committed adultery with the woman, Euphiletos would not have killed him." (In fact, Eratoshenes *did* commit adultery with the woman, and we know what happened as a result.)
