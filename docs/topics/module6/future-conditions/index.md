## Future conditions 

- Unlike past and present, don't (can't) fall into categories of "factual/contrafactual"
- instead: "more vivid" / "less vivid" statements about the future.
- meaning:
    - "More vivid": a confident statement ("this will happen")
    - "Less vivid": maybe this will happen.



| Condition | Protasis | Apodosis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| More vivid | ἐάν + subjunctive | future indicative|
| Less vivid | εἰ + optative | optative  + ἄν  |

Formation:

- "more vivid" uses an indicative, like stating a fact ("this *will* happen - if the condition comes about")
- "less vivid":  optative in both clauses, ἄν in apodosis.  (Not contrafactual: that's indicative mood + ἄν.) "This *could* happen, if the condition comes about -- but I'm not at all sure that it will."


Choice of tenses in subjunctive and optative (both in protasis and apodosis) reflects aspect (just like in protasis of generalizing conditions).
