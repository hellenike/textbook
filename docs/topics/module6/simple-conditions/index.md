## Simple conditions

### Structure of conditions

Conditions are sentences with (at least) two clauses:  a main clause, like any other sentence, and a subordinate clause.  In English, the subordinate clause is introduced by the conjunction "if"; the corresponding Greek conjunction is εἰ. English can include or omit an introductory "then" to introduce the main clause.  "*If* the plaintiff proves his case, the jury will convict the defendant" and  "*If* the plaintiff proves his case, *then* the jury will convict the defendant" are both possible.  Greek does not mark the main clause with any special word: it's just a regular sentence (like "The jury will convict the defendant.")

We borrow from Greek two grammatical terms for these clauses.  The clause that is "set out" as the hypothesis (the "if" clause) is called the *protasis* (πρότασις), and the resulting main clause (the "then" clause) is called the *apodosis* (ἀπόδοσις).

As in English, τηε protasis may either precede or follow the apodosis.

### Simple conditions about present or past time

*Simple conditions* use the *indicative* mood in both clauses. They present the statement as a straightforward factual relation: when the protasis is true, the apodosis is also true.  You choose the tense as you would for any other indicative statement (e.g., for past time, the aorist will refer to a single, contained event, the imperfect to a repeated or ongoing action).




### Introducing the present indicative

At this point, we will add a further tense of the indicative to your repertoire.  

#### Formation of the present indicative

Like the imperfect tense, all three voices of the present are built on the stem of the first principal part.  Like *all* forms built on the first principal part (finite forms, participles, infinitives), the present indicative has identical endings for the middle and passive voices.  The present indicative endings are illutrated her for the verb γράφω :


| Person/number | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3.s | γράφ-**ει** | γράφ-**εται** | γράφ-**εται** |
| 3.pl | γράφ-**ουσι** | γράφ-**ονται** | γράφ-**ονται** |


#### Meaning of the present indicative 

The *present indicative* refers to events that are happening at the time of the statement. It does not distinguish aspect the way that our contrast of imperfect and aorist does for past-time narrative, and might, in different contexts, correspond to an English simple present ("they write"), progressive present ("they are writing") or emphatic present ("they do write").
