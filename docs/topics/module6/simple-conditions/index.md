## Simple conditions

### Structure of conditions

- "if" clause (*protasis*): introduced by εἰ 
- "then" clause (*apodosis*): no conjunction used in Greek

As in English, protasis may either precede (more common?) or follow the apodosis.

### Simple conditions about present or past time

- use *indicative* mood in both clauses: choose tense as you would for any other indicative statement

#### Introducing the present indicative

> Notice that the present tense does not offer the same distinction of aspect that we get for past time with the contrast of imperfect/aorist.
