# Approaching a passage at sight


## A hierarchy of verbal units


### Main clauses


When you look at a Greek sentence, make a habit of beginning by identifying the principal clause.  Normally, in connected prose this will have at least two elements:  a verb, and either a conjunction or particle connecting the sentence to its context.


#### The main verb

>Find the main verb before you do anything else!


Most frequently, the principle verb will be a conjugated form in the indicative mood.

Some possible exceptions include commands in the imperative, negative commands in the subjunctive, wishes in the optative, or future less vivid conditions with the main verb (the apodosis of the condition) in the optative.

If a particle such as ἄν or εἴθε appears with the main verb, note this.

#### Complements to the main verb


If the main verb is used with a supplementary participle (e.g., φαίνομαι, τυγχάνω), find the participle.

If the main verb requires a complementary infinitive (e.g., ἐθέλὡ), find the infinitive.

If the main verb introduces indirect statement, identify the structure of the indirect statement (accusative subject + infinitive after verbs of speaking;  participle after verbs of thinking or perceiving).

Does your verb take an object?  Make sure you know how the verb and object are constructed (e.g., ἀκούω is constructed with a
genitive for source, or person, you hear from, but accusative for the thing you hear).  Find any objects (direct or indirect) of the main verb .

#### The connecting word


Greek sentences regularly connect the main clause of a sentence to the larger context by a conjunction (such as καί) or a particle
(such as δέ).  Identifying how the main clause is connected to what precedes or follows will help you understand the logic of the sentence. It will also help you understand the syntax of the sentence, since you will not mistakenly interpret the conjunction or particle as
coordinating parts of the same sentence.


Once you have worked out the main clause, you’re ready to identify subordinate clauses.


### Subordinate clauses

Once you have identified the main clause, find the secondary clauses, and answer these two questions:

- What conjunction introduces the clause?
- What is the verb of the clause, and what is its tense and mood?

This should let you identify the kind of clause (e.g., purpose, protasis of a condition...)


You can then work out any complements to the  verb, as you did for the main clause.


Once you have worked out the secondary clauses, you should look at attributive participles.



### Attributive participles

After you have worked out the [principal clause](../principalclause), and all [secondary clauses](../secondaryclauses), look for participles in attributive position.  You can recognize these easily, because, in addition to agreeing in gender, case and number with the noun they modify, they will be tightly linked to the noun by the definite article.

>Translate attributive participles with English relative clauses.


### Circumstantial participles


After you have translated [attributive participles](../attributiveptcpls/) with English relative clauses, you can work on the remaining, circumstantial participles. The rich and flexible use of participles is a distinctive feature of Greek that has no single counterpart in English. In general, you should **not** translate a
circumstantial participle with an English participle!

>As a general rule, try to find an appropriate English secondary clause to translate Greek participles.


Like any adjective, the participle will take not only its gender and number, but also its case from the noun it agrees with. When the participle agrees with a noun that has no syntactic relation to the rest of the syntax, they are normally in the genitive case (the
“absolute” usage of the noun, the genitive absolute).


The following table summaries the main possibilities  you should consider in interpreting a circumstantial participle.



| Sense of	participle |Tense of participle or other syntax | Translation hint |
|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Temporal | In general, aorist expresses that participial action occurred before primary verb;  present tense expresses that participial action is simultaneous with primary verb. | “After ...” (aorist) or “While...” (present) |
| Causal | | “Because...” |
| Manner | | “By ...” (doing something) |
|  Descriptive | | May sometimes correspond to an English participle (e.g., “doing ...”) |
| Concessive | |“Although ...”  |
| Purpose | Ὡς  + future participle |  “In order to ...” |
| View point of subject |Ὡς  + participle (not in future tense) | “On the grounds that...” |
| Conditional | Equivalent to protasis of a condition; note that negative will therefore be μή. | “If ...”  (translation will depend  on type of condition) |


## Rereading

At this stage, you have analyzed the entire sentence. You can now reread the sentence with a full understanding of its syntax.  Better yet, reread the whole paragraph it occurs in (or extend this idea to reread the entire text you are studying...)
