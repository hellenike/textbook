## The aorist indicative

### Verbs

- we'll always begin our reading with *verbal units* that express an action
- the form of a verb expresses the *subject* as well as the *verb*.  Example:  the form ἐκέλευσε means "he or she ordered"; the form ἐκέλευσαν means "they ordered".  These are complete sentences that do not need a separate word for "he", "she" or "they."

### Overview of Greek verbs

Main points to cover:


- Greek verbs can have five properties: PNTMV.  (We call verb forms with these five properties *finite* verb forms.)
- you recognize the form of a Greek form from its combination of a stem and an ending
- Greek verbs have six stems called *principal parts*
- accent of finite verb forms is *recessive*

### The *aorist indicative*

Main points: tense and mood


- the indicative mood is the mood for narrating factual events
- Greek has multiple tenses for narrating events in the past
- the *aorist* tense views an action as a single or completed action


Main points: voice

- the Greek verb has *three* voices (!!): AMP
- not all verbs appear in all three voices.  Example:  the verb γίγνομαι "to become" always uses the middle voice.
- the aorist tense forms the active and middle voices from the *third* principal part; it forms the passive voice from the *sixth* principal part


### Forming the aorist indicative


#### Active and middle

- (1) principal parts give an example form in the first singular indicative active of a representative tense: start by dropping the first singular ending and the accent from the third principal part:

> ἔδειξα -> ἐδειξ-
>
> ἐκέλευσα -> ἐκελευσ-

- (2) Add appropriate ending.  For today, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural.

| Number | Active ending | Middle ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| singular |  -ε | -ατο |
| plural | -ᾰν | -αντο |


- (3) Apply recessive accent.  





#### Passive

- (1) Drop the first singular ending and the accent from the sixth principal part


> ἐδείχθην -> ἐδειχθ-
>
> ἐκελεύθην -> ἐκελευθ-


- (2) Add appropriate ending

| Number | Ending |
| --- | --- |
| singular | -η  |
| plural | -ησαν |

- (3) Apply recessive accent.  



#### Examples

| | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| singular |  ἔδειξε | ἐδείξατο | ἐδείχθη |
| plural | ἔδειξαν | ἐδείξαντο |ἐδείχθησαν  |



| | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| singular |  ἐκέλευσε | ἐκελεύσατο | ἐκελεύθη |
| plural | ἐκέλευσαν | ἐκελεύσαντο | ἐκελεύθησαν  |
