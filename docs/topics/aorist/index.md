## The aorist indicative

### Verbs

- we'll always begin our reading with *verbal units* that express an action
- the form of a verb expresses the *subject* as well as the *verb*.  Example:  the form ἐκέλευσε means "he or she ordered"; the form ἐκέλευσαν means "they ordered".  These are complete sentences that do not need a separate word for "he", "she" or "they."

### The *aorist indicative*

As described above, finite verbs have five properties: person, number, tense, mood, and voice. "Aorist" is a tense, and "indicative" is a mood. 

- the indicative mood is the mood for narrating factual events
- Greek has multiple tenses for narrating events in the past
- the *aorist* tense views an action as a single or completed action

To learn this tense + mood, you will need to learn the person and number in all three voices: active, middle, and passive.
As you learn it for any particular verb, you will notice that not all verbs appear in all three voices.  For example, the verb γίγνομαι "to become" always and only uses the middle voice. 



### Forming the aorist indicative

The aorist tense forms the active and middle voices from the *third* principal part; it forms the passive voice from the *sixth* principal part. So You will need to pay attention the the principal parts for any particular verb to see what forms are possible. For example, if the third prinicipal part appears in the middle, then no active forms are used. If a verb does not have a sixth prinicipal part, then no passive forms are used.

#### Active and middle

- (1) principal parts give an example form in the first singular indicative active of a representative tense: start by dropping the first singular ending and the accent from the third principal part:

> ἔδειξα -> ἐδειξ-
>
> ἐκέλευσα -> ἐκελευσ-

- (2) Add appropriate ending.  For today, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural.

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  -ε | -ατο |
| 3rd plural | -ᾰν | -αντο |


- (3) Apply recessive accent.  





#### Passive

- (1) Drop the first singular ending and the accent from the sixth principal part


> ἐδείχθην -> ἐδειχθ-
>
> ἐκελεύθην -> ἐκελευθ-


- (2) Add appropriate ending

| Person and Number | Ending |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd singular | -η  |
| 3rd plural | -ησαν |

- (3) Apply recessive accent.  



#### Examples

| | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἔδειξε | ἐδείξατο | ἐδείχθη |
| 3rd plural | ἔδειξαν | ἐδείξαντο |ἐδείχθησαν  |



| | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἐκέλευσε | ἐκελεύσατο | ἐκελεύθη |
| 3rd plural | ἐκέλευσαν | ἐκελεύσαντο | ἐκελεύθησαν  |
