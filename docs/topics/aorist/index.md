## The aorist indicative


The form of a finite verb in ancient Greek expresses the *subject* as well as the *verb*: it is complete verbal unit by itself.  Example: the form ἐκέλευσε means "he or she ordered"; the form ἐκέλευσαν means "they ordered."  These are already complete sentences that do not need a separate word for "he", "she" or "they."

### The indicative mood and narrating events in the past

As described above, finite verbs have five properties: person, number, tense, mood, and voice. 

"Indicative" is a mood, one of the four that ancient Greek has. It is the mode of verb used for narrating factual events. As such, it is a frequently seen mood in most texts.

Ancient Greek has more than one tense for narrating events in the past. The distinction between those past tenses, then, is one of *aspect* —that is, how to think of or picture the action the verb is representing. 

- the *aorist* tense expresses an action as single and simple, without indication of its completion or continuation
- the *imperfect* tense expresses an action as contiunous, started, ongoing, habitual or in any way incomplete

The choice of tense, then, involves not only an indication that the events happened in the past, but other information about the event. Do you want to emphasize it as a single incident? Choose the aorist indicative if so. Or do you want to indicate that it happened over a length of time, was repeated or habitual, perhaps was started but not completed? The imperfect indicative will give you the means to add those shades of meaning.

### Meaning of aorist indicative

The aorist indicate represents the action in a way that can be (and has been) described as "single," "simple," "distinct," the equivalent to a snapshot of the action. The tense that is the closest to this idea in English is the "simple past," the past tense formed in the active voice by adding -ed to the verb stem, or made by changes to the stem, with no other "helping" verbs. Examples of the "simple past" in the active voice: He walked, she ran, they watched. She taught, they learned. 

To understand a verb form, you must take into account all five properties: person, number, tense, mood and voice. In the active voice, the subject performs the action. In the passive voice, the subject receives the action. The middle voice is, as the name indicates, in between active and passive, where the subject performs the action in some way for themselves.

To use as examples the verbs of "show" and "command" (compare the sample Greek verbs below), the 3rd person plural aorist indicative in each voice could be translated into English as follows:
- Active: "they showed," "they commanded"
- Middle: "they showed (for their own benefit)," "they commanded themselves"
- Passive: "they were shown," "they were commanded"


> ? Example with ἄρχω ?  Active voice "to be first, rule" ; passive "to be rule"; middle "to make onself first {over something in the genitive case}, to begin"



### Forming the aorist indicative

To learn this tense + mood, you will need to learn the person and number in all three voices: active, middle, and passive.

As you learn it for any particular verb, you will notice that not all verbs appear in all three voices. For example, the verb γίγνομαι "to become" always and only uses the middle voice. 

The aorist tense forms the active and middle voices from the *third* principal part; it forms the passive voice from the *sixth* principal part. So you will need to pay attention to the principal parts for any particular verb to see what forms are possible. For example, if the third principal part appears in the middle, then no active forms are used. If a verb does not have a sixth prinicipal part, then no passive forms are used.

As you look at the third principal part, there are two different patterns of endings. These are referred to as "first" and "second" aorists. The different endings do not have different meanings except in rare cases when both exist for the same verb. That is, both first and second aorists, both sets of endings, represent the single action in the past, and you will accordingly translate each with the English simple past. Compare the two systems of past-tense formation in English: adding "-ed" to the verb stem (which are called "regular" or "weak" verbs) or a change in the verb stem ("irregular" or "strong" verbs): I walked (weak) vs. I went (strong). I consumed (weak) vs. I ate (strong).

You can recognize a verb that has a first aorist by a third principal ending in -α or -άμην. Verbs that have a second aorist have a third principal part that ends in -ον or -όμην. We will return to the second aorist forms later in this module.


#### Aorist active and middle indicative of first aorist verbs

Once you have identified a verb as a first aorist verb, you form other persons and numbers by the following process:

- (1) the third principal part is in the first singular indicative: start by dropping the first singular ending and the accent from the third principal part:

> ἔδειξα -> ἐδειξ-
>
> ἐκέλευσα -> ἐκελευσ-

- (2) Add appropriate ending.  For today, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural.

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  -ε | -ατο |
| 3rd plural | -ᾰν | -αντο |


- (3) Apply recessive accent.  



#### Aorist Passive Indicative

You may see somewhere the reference to "first" and "second" aorists in the aorist passive, but for most purposes, that is a complication we need not be concerned with. All sixth principal parts can be used the same way to form aorist passive forms.

- (1) Drop the first singular ending -ην and the accent from the sixth principal part

> ἐδείχθην -> ἐδειχθ-
>
> ἐκελεύθην -> ἐκελευθ-


- (2) Add appropriate ending

| Person and Number | Ending |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd singular | -η  |
| 3rd plural | -ησαν |

- (3) Apply recessive accent.  



#### Examples

| | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἔδειξε | ἐδείξατο | ἐδείχθη |
| 3rd plural | ἔδειξαν | ἐδείξαντο |ἐδείχθησαν  |



| | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἐκέλευσε | ἐκελεύσατο | ἐκελεύθη |
| 3rd plural | ἐκέλευσαν | ἐκελεύσαντο | ἐκελεύθησαν  |
