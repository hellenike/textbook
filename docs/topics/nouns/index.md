## Greek nouns 

"Noun" is a part of speech. The ancient Greek word for noun is ὄνομα, which means "name." Nouns name a person, animal, place, or thing (whether that "thing" is concrete or abstract). In a clause or sentence, nouns can fulfill various functions. A noun might be the subject of the verb, the person, place, or thing doing the action the verb represents. A noun might be the object of the the verb, the recipient of the verb's action, or the indirect (or secondary) object of that action. A noun might further describe another noun, or be paired with a preposition to act adjectivally or adverbially. It may decribe the means by which the action of the verb happens. Or it might name the addressee of the sentence. In ancient Greek, the function of the noun is represented by its case, and the case is indicated by the ending attached to the noun's stem. We have already seen that endings provide a great deal of information in a verb form, and the same is true in nouns. Identifying the case of a noun is key to understanding how it is functioning in that particular sentence. 


### Overview of nouns 

All ancient Greek nouns have gender, case, and number.
- There are three grammatical **genders**: masculine, feminine, and neuter.
- **Case** indicates the function of a noun in a sentence. Cases are expressed and identified by endings. There are five cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative. 
- Ancient Greek has three **numbers**: singular, plural, and dual. Dual is used for two nouns considered a pair; reminder: we will not see the dual in our readings this year. 

#### Dictionary entry of nouns 

The dictionary entry of a noun efficiently encodes all the information you need to know in order to produce all of its cases and numbers. The first word tells you its nominative singular form, the second word is its genitive singular form, and the third word, in the form of the article, tells you its gender(s).

#### Declension 

Nouns are organized into “declensions,” a category of nouns that share the same set of endings. In Greek, there are three declensions of nouns. In this module, we will learn forms of the nominative and genitive cases of all three declensions, with the variation that occurs due to the noun's gender or due to linguistic changes within the language.

#### Accents on nouns: persistent accent

You have learned the general rules for Greek accents and the rules for determining accents on verbs, which are *recessive* accents. 

The same general rules for accents apply to nouns and adjectives, but nouns and adjectives carry what we call a *persistent* accent, which means that you must learn where the accent resides as you learn the word. Then, you apply the rules of accentuation as you decline the noun or adjective into its full range of cases. 

Reminder of rules that you will apply in declining persistent accents:
- the accent will fall on one of the final three syllables
- the antepenult can be accented only with an acute accent and only when the ultima is short
- circumflex accents appear only on long vowels and diphthongs
- when the penult is accented, it will be accented with an acute if it is a short vowel or if the ultima is long. If the penult is long and the ultima is short and the penult is accented, it will be accented with a circumflex.

Some general rules and results of rules for persistent accents:

1. The position of the persistent accent is shown on the nominative form of adjectives and nominative/genitive forms of nouns. You must learn the position of the accent when you learn the word—there is no way of predicting it other than simply learning it along with the word. The “position” is the vowel that carries the accent in the nominative(/genitive) form(s). When you are studying your vocabulary, say the word out loud with the accented syllable stressed so you can remember the accent along with the word.
2. The accent will stay on that syllable unless it is forced to move because of the rules above. One example of an accent on a noun or adjective that changes position is when the persistent accent starts on the antepenult in the nominative form. Remember, the antepenult can only carry an accent when the ultima is short, and when in other cases the ultima changes to long, that accent will have to move to the penult (ex. θάλαττα has the accent on the penult in the nominative and its ultima has a short alpha. In the genitive, the ultima is then long (the eta is always long) and so the accent shifts to the penult: θαλάττης.)
3. The accent may, however, change form one kind of accent to another while on the same syllable—again, observing the rules above. So when a noun starts with a persistent accent of a circumflex on the penult, that, too, will change form but not place depending on the quantity of the ending (ex. δοῦλος has the penult accented—it is a diphthong and therefore long while the ultima has an omicron, which is always short, and so the accent must be a circumflex. In the genitive, the ultima becomes long, and so the accent must be an acute according to the rules: δούλου.) 
4. If the penult has a short vowel and carries the persistent accent, the accent never changes place or form: ex. λόγος, λόγου, λόγῳ, λόγον, λόγε, λόγοι, λόγων, λόγοις, λόγους, λόγοι.
5. When the ultima is accented, it will change from an acute in the nominative singular to a circumflex in the genitive and dative singular, then back to an acute in the accusative. This is a pattern you should learn as you learn your declensions, such as the article later in this module. You will see that the genitive plural and the dative plural carry a circumflex, as well.  Ex. τιμή, τιμῆς, τιμῇ, τιμήν, τιμή, τιμαί, τιμῶν, τιμαῖς, τιμάς, τιμαί. Remember that final –οι and final –αι on noun and adjective forms count as short when determining accents, even though they are diphthongs.

Practice and learn patterns of persistent accents so that as you learn vocabulary you can recognize what the persistent will do in each case in the singular and plural. In the "review" section in this module, you will find demonstrations of these patterns as well as opportunities for practicing them.

### Functions of cases: the nominative and genitive cases  

The **nominative case** is a naming case. Its most frequent function is to indicate the subject of a finite verb. Subject-verb agreement means that the person and number of the subject must be the same as the person and number of the verb. So a _singular_ noun in the nominative will have a 3rd person _singular_ verb form. In most cases, a nominative _plural_ noun acting as the subject will have agree with a 3rd person _plural_ verb. Note, however, that in Ancient Greek, **neuter** nominative _plural_ nouns acting as the subject often take a 3rd person _singular_ verb form.

The **genitive case** is used to relate one noun to another/make one noun depend on another. We often translate nouns in the genitive case with the English preposition "of." We will learn more about the range of functions of the genitive case later in this module.

### Forms of the nominative and genitive cases 

The case endings of nouns the singular nominative and genitive cases reflect both the noun's gender and what declension it belongs to.

#### First declension

Note on the persistent accent: the first declension has one important exception to the expected position of the accent, in the genitive plural. The genitive plural ending of the first declension is always accented with a circumflex. There is a reason for this apparent exception, which has to do with the linguistic development of these forms over time. 

Notice below that all the plural endings in this declension are the same, even with the variations in the singular.

For feminine first-declension nouns that end in -η

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -η | -αι |
| Genitive | -ης | -ῶν |

For feminine first-declension nouns that end in -ᾱ

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ᾱ | -αι |
| Genitive | -ᾱς | -ῶν |

For feminine first-declension nouns that end in -ᾰ

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ᾰ | -αι |
| Genitive | -ης | -ῶν |

For masculine first-declension nouns that end in -ης / -ᾱς

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ης / -ᾱς | -αι |
| Genitive | -ου | -ῶν |


#### Second declension

For masculine or feminine second-declension nouns that end in -ος

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ος | -οι |
| Genitive | -ου | -ων |

For neuter second-declension nouns that end in -ον

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ον | -ᾰ |
| Genitive | -ου | -ων |


#### Third declension

The third declension also contains nouns of all three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. The third declension is sometimes called the "consonant declension" because most nouns in this declension have stems ending in a consonant. Because of linguistic changes to different kinds ofstems, there is a variety of patterns that you will need to become familiar with over time. Here we introduce just the basic pattern of endings that signify the third declension.

For masculine or feminine third-declension nouns:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ς or no ending | -ες  |
| Genitive | -ος  | -ων |

  Note that the genitive singular ending in this declension, -ος, is the same as the masculine or feminine ending of the nominative singular form in the second declension. That shows us that knowing what declension a noun belongs to, as well as what gender it is, is crucial for knowing what form the ending is indicating. Compare also the neuter nominative plural ending in both the second and third declensions, -ᾰ, and one of the feminine nominative singular forms in the first declension, also -ᾰ.

For neuter third-declension nouns:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | - | -ᾰ |
| Genitive | -ος | -ων |
