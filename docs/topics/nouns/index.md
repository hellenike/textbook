## Greek nouns 

### Overview of nouns 

All ancient Greek nouns have gender, case, and number.
- There are three grammatical **genders**: masculine, feminine, and neuter.
- **Case** indicates the function of a noun in a sentence. Cases are expressed and identified by endings. There are five cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative. 
- Ancient Greek has three **numbers**: singular, plural, and dual. Dual is used for two nouns considered a pair; we will not see the dual in our readings this year. 

#### Dictionary entry of nouns 

The dictionary entry of a noun efficiently encodes all the information you need to know in order to produce all of its cases and numbers. The first word tells you its nominative singular form, the second word is its genitive singular form, and the third word, in the form of the definite article, tells you its gender(s).

#### Declension 

Nouns are organized into “declensions,” a category of nouns that share the same set of endings. In Greek, there are three declensions of nouns. In this module, we will learn some cases of all three declensions.

### The nominative and genitive cases  

The **nominative case** is a naming case; its most frequent function is to indicate the subject of a sentence. 

The **genitive case** is used to relate one noun to another/make one noun depend on another. We often translate nouns in the genitive case with the English preposition "of." 

### Forming the nominative and genitive cases 

#### First declension

The accent on nouns is *persistent*, which means that you must learn where the accent resides as you learn the word. Then, you apply the rules of accentuation as you deline the noun into its full range of cases. The first declension has one important exception, in the genitive plural. The genitive plural ending of the first declension is always accented with a circumflex. Notice below that all the plural endings in this declension are the same, even with the variations in the singular
