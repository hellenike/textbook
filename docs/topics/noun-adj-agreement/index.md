## Noun-adjective agreement

In ancient Greek, an adjective modifying a noun must agree with, or match, that noun in gender, case, and number. Adjectives from any of the three declensions can modify nouns from any of the three declensions. That is, the adjective need not "match" the noun in declension and its particular case endings, although sometimes by coincidence, the endings will look the same, especially if the adjective and noun come from the same declension. 

Examples of noun-adjective agreement from Lysias I.6-10

τὸν ἄλλον χρόνον masculine accusative singular

τῷ πρώτῳ χρόνῳ masculine dative singular

πολὺν χρόνον masculine accusative singular

οἰκειότητα μεγίστην feminine accusative singular

οἰκονόμος δεινή feminine nominative singular

ἡ ἐμὴ γυνή feminine nominative singular (but note that γυνή is a 3rd declension noun, and the genitive case would be τῆς ἐμῆς γυναικός)

γυναῖκα σωφρονεστάτην feminine accusative singular

πάντων τῶν κακῶν neuter genitive plural

οἰκίδιον διπλοῦν neuter nominative singular


Because of the lack of gender and case with nouns and lack of even number with adjectives, English does not have explicit rules about noun-adjective agreement (as it does for subject-verb agreement, for example). The adjective does not change between one green show or a pair of green shoes, an old woman or a group of old men. 

But note that English has interesting “ingrained” rules about the order of adjectives when there is more than one. Most native speakers of English know these rules as just what “sounds right” or “sounds wrong,”  “Old green shoes” obeys these rules while “green old shoes” does not.

English language learners actually are asked to learn these rules explicitly. That is a good reminder of the way in which language rules are defined for non-native-speakers (as we all are for ancient Greek) in a way that complicates the sense of a language meant to communicate.
