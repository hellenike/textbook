## Adjectives (τὸ ἐπίθετον)

"Adjective" is a part of speech. The Greek name is τὸ ἐπίθετον, which, as noted at the beginning of the module, means "add-on" or "placed on." The function of adjectives is to modify nouns or pronouns. That is, the adjective describes or delineates the noun or pronoun further, it is "placed on" the noun or "adds on" to it. 

Like nouns, adjectives have gender, case, and number. To identify the form of an adjective, you must identify all three features.

### Dictionary entry and declension of adjectives

The dictionary entry of an adjective will be all the nominative singular forms. The order of those nominative singular forms that dictionaries use is: masculine nominative singular, feminine nominative singular, and neuter nominative singular. For some adjectives, the feminine and masculine forms share the same endings, and so there will be only two sets of endings, the first listed for the masculine and feminine and the second for the neuter. Third declension adjectives have a wider variety of endings, just as the nouns do, and may also have different endings for the masculine, feminine, and neuter forms, or one set for the masculine and feminine and another for the neuter. 

Adjectives in ancient Greek are organized into the same three declensions as nouns, and like nouns, adjectives belong to each of the three declensions. An adjective of any declension can modify a noun of any declension.

You will identify the declension of an adjective by the endings of the nominative singular forms and the corresponding noun declension endings.

#### Examples of adjective declension

Many three-ending adjectives are what we call "first and second declension" adjectives because the feminine forms use first declensions case endings while the masculine and neuter forms use second declension adjectives. A representative example of these adjectives is ἀγαθός, ἀγαθή, ἀγαθόν. An English translation for this adjective is "good," and like "good" in English, there is a range of ways people or things can be ἀγαθός, ἀγαθή, ἀγαθόν. As you see this adjective in your readings, what nuances of meaning does the context give to this adjective?  

**Declension of ἀγαθός, ἀγαθή, ἀγαθόν**

| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem | Neut | Masc | Fem | Neut |
| Nominative | ἀγαθός | ἀγαθή | ἀγαθόν | ἀγαθοί  | ἀγαθαί  | ἀγαθά  |
| Genitive | ἀγαθοῦ  | ἀγαθῆς  | ἀγαθοῦ | ἀγαθῶν  | ἀγαθῶν | ἀγαθῶν |
| Dative | ἀγαθῷ  | ἀγαθῇ | ἀγαθῷ | ἀγαθοῖς | ἀγαθαῖς  | ἀγαθοῖς |
| Accusative | ἀγαθόν | ἀγαθήν | ἀγαθόν | ἀγαθούς  | ἀγαθάς  | ἀγαθά  |

Other adjectives are called "first and third declension" adjectives because the feminine forms belong to the first declension while the masculine and neuter belong to the third declension. As we have already seen with verb prinicpal parts, the more common an adjective is, the more likely it is to be "irregular" in its forms. The most common adjective in our readings this year will be the adjective πᾶς, πᾶσα, πᾶν, and its compound form ἅπας, ἅπασα, ἅπαν. The English equivalents, depending on the particular use in context, include "all," "every" and "whole." That is, both adjectives indicate a completeness or entirety, and ἅπας, ἅπασα, ἅπαν emphasizes that quality even more. They decline the same way, although note the difference in persistent accent between the two.

**Declension of πᾶς, πᾶσα, πᾶν**

| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem | Neut | Masc | Fem | Neut |
| Nominative | πᾶς  | πᾶσα  | πᾶν | πάντες  | πᾶσαι   | πάντα   |
| Genitive | παντός  | πάσης   | παντός  | πάντων   | πασῶν  | πάντων  |
| Dative | παντί  | πάσῃ | παντί | πᾶσι or πᾶσιν | πάσαις  | πᾶσι or πᾶσιν |
| Accusative | πάντα | πᾶσαν | πᾶν  | πάντας   | πάσας   | πάντα   |


### Noun-adjective agreement

In ancient Greek, an adjective modifying a noun must agree with, or match, that noun in gender, case, and number. Adjectives from any of the three declensions can modify nouns from any of the three declensions. That is, the adjective need not "match" the noun in _declension_ and the case endings belonging to that declension, although sometimes by coincidence, the endings will look the same, especially if the adjective and noun come from the same declension. 

Examples of noun-adjective agreement from Lysias 1.6-10

τὸν ἄλλον χρόνον masculine accusative singular

τῷ πρώτῳ χρόνῳ masculine dative singular

πολὺν χρόνον masculine accusative singular

οἰκειότητα μεγίστην feminine accusative singular

οἰκονόμος δεινή feminine nominative singular

ἡ ἐμὴ γυνή feminine nominative singular (but note that γυνή is a 3rd declension noun, and the genitive case would be τῆς ἐμῆς γυναικός)

γυναῖκα σωφρονεστάτην feminine accusative singular

πάντων τῶν κακῶν neuter genitive plural

οἰκίδιον διπλοῦν neuter nominative singular


Because of the lack in English of gender and case with nouns and lack of even number with adjectives, English does not have explicit rules about noun-adjective agreement (as it does for subject-verb agreement, for example). The adjective does not change form between *one green shoe* and *two green shoes*, an *old woman* or a group of *old men*. 

But note that English has interesting “ingrained” rules about the _order_ of adjectives when there is more than one. Most native speakers of English know these rules as just what “sounds right” or “sounds wrong,”  “Old green shoes” obeys these rules while “green old shoes” does not. See more here [https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160908-the-language-rules-we-know-but-dont-know-we-know] for language rules English speakers know but don't know we know


English language learners are sometimes asked to learn these rules about adjective order explicitly. That is a good reminder of the way in which language rules are sometimes defined for non-native-speakers (as we all are for ancient Greek) in a way that complicates the sense of a language meant to communicate.

### Adjective placement: attributive and predicate positions

Adjectives can describe a noun, and thus in ancient Greek must agree with that noun in gender, case, and number, from different syntatical positions in a sentence. 

As we saw earlier in the section on the article, one of those positions is called the **attributive** position, when the adjective qualifies the noun within a noun phrase. The other is called the **predicate** position, when the adjective is part of the predicate of the clause or sentence. Compare these exmaples in English:

> _The tall woman went to the market._ The adjective "tall" is in the attributive position.

> _The woman is tall._ The adjective "tall" is in the predicate position, syntactically connected to the verb of the sentence.

In both sentences, the adjective "tall" describes the woman, and so in ancient Greek would be the same gender, case, and number as the noun "woman": since "woman" is the subject of each sentence, the adjective will be feminine, nominative, singular, as the noun is.

**Attributive** position in ancient Greek follows the article that modifies the noun. The article can be repeated to create this position:
- ἡ μεγάλη γυνή  'the tall woman'
- ἡ γυνὴ ἡ μεγάλη  'the tall woman'
- γυνὴ ἡ μεγάλη 'the tall woman'

Note that the article may be absent, and if so, the word order of adjective and noun is less restricted, such as the example of οἰκονόμος δεινή above. 

**Predicate** position is a placement outside of the article + noun phrase.

> ἡ μεγάλη γυνὴ εἰς τὴν ἀγορὰν ἦλθον. OR ἡ γυνὴ ἡ μεγάλη εἰς τὴν ἀγορὰν ἦλθον. _The tall woman went to the market._ (attributive position)

> ἡ γυνὴ μεγάλη ἐστίν. _The woman is tall._ (predicate position)


### Adjectives used as nouns, substantive adjectives

Adjectives, and indeed any kind of modifier, can be used with the article to function as nouns. A term for this use is "substantive adjectives." English does this, too. In a sentence such as "Only the good die young," we understand "the good" to refer to "good persons," a group that is abstract in nature. In the sentence "That's all for the good," we understand "the good" to refer to an abstract quality.

Ancient Greek tends to use substantive adjectives much more often than English does, though, and takes advantage of the gender and number of adjectives to express a wider variety of the understood noun. Because ancient Greek has that flexibility, to understand and translate it properly, you must supply a noun that reflects that gender and number:

- ὁ ἀγαθός, masculine singular, "the good man"; οἱ ἀγαθοί masculine plural "good men," "the good men" or "the good" (ancient Greek defaults to the masculine when describing a group of persons of mixed gender, whether possible or actual)

- ἡ ἀγαθή feminine singular, "the good woman"; αἱ ἀγαθαί feminine plural "the good women," "good women"

- τὸ ἀγαθόν neuter singular, "the good thing" or "the good" as an abstract quality; τὰ ἀγαθά "good things," "the good things," "goods" or "the good". Neuter plural substantives are especially flexible in meaning and thus can be used in a variety of contexts.

### Example from Lysias 1.7 to practice with

Euphiletos describes to the jury his wife at the beginning of their marriage:

ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, πασῶν ἦν βελτίστη· καὶ γὰρ οἰκονόμος δεινὴ καὶ φειδωλὸς ἀγαθὴ
