## The article 

English has a definite article, "the" and an indefinite article, "a" or "an." Ancient Greek has only one article, and its uses are both straightforward and subtle.


### The article and attributive and predicate positions

Nouns can be modified in several ways, including by adjectives ("the small house") and by other nouns ("the man's house"). In ancient Greek, the article plays a crucial role in connecting these modifiers to the noun they modify.

When a modifying word or phrase is connected to the noun it describes by the article, we call that the **attributive** position.  When the modifier is not connected to its noun by an article, we call that the **predicate** position. The terms "attributive" and "predicate" summarize the difference in meaning between the two positions.  When a word or phrase is in attributive position, it functions as an *attribute* of the noun; that is, it describes or qualifies the noun within a noun phrase. The grammatical term *predicate* refers to the part of a clause that contains a verb and states something about the subject.  Compare these examples in English:

> *The tall woman went to the market*. 

The adjective "tall" is in the *attributive* position, and is part of a noun phrase, "the tall woman." The entire noun phrase is the subject of the sentence, but if we dropped the adjective, the sentence would still make sense, we would just have a less precise description of the subject ("The woman went to the market.")

> *The woman is tall*. 

Here, the adjective "tall" is in the *predicate* position. Together with the linking verb *is*, it makes a statement about the subject ("The woman").  The complete predicate is an essential part of the sentence;  dropping the adjective from the predicate completely alters the meaning of the sentence ("The woman is.")

### The nominative and genitive forms of the article

In the following section, we'll see how to describe one noun with a second noun using the genitive case.  Memorize the nominative and genitive forms of the article so that you can recognize whether or not nouns in the genitive case are in attributive position.
