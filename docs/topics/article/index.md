## The article 
The article is used so frequently in ancient Greek that it must and will become familiar, with its uses and nuances grasped with practice. 

English has a definite article, "the" and an indefinite article, "a" or "an." Ancient Greek has only one article, and its uses are both straightforward and subtle.

### Forms of the article
The article modifying a noun agrees with it in gender, case, and number. There is a full paradigm of forms with all three genders in all cases and numbers, and it is important to learn to recognize these forms easily. Pay careful attention to and memorize the spelling, including accents and breathing marks, on these forms. There is no vocative form of the article.

| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem | Neut | Masc | Fem | Neut |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Nominative | ὁ | ἡ | τό | οἱ | αἱ | τά |
| Genitive | τοῦ | τῆς | τοῦ | τῶν | τῶν | τῶν |
| Dative | τῷ | τῇ | τῷ | τοῖς | ταῖς | τοῖς |
| Accusative | τόν | τήν | τό | τούς | τάς | τά |

Note that the alpha in the neuter nominative and accusative plural form, τά, is a short alpha, while the alpha in the feminine accusative plural form, τάς, is a long alpha.  

### Some uses of the article

- Like the English definite article, the ancient Greek article may modify its noun by making it definite or particle: ἡ οἰκία "the house"
- If indicated by the context, the article can convey a possessive adjective: ὁ ἀνὴρ ἐκ **τῆς** οἰκίας ἦλθεν, "The man went out of **his** house" 
- Differently from English, however, the article may be used to denote a general class, οἱ ἄνθρωποι "people" or "humans" 
- Also differently from English, the article is frequently used with a proper noun, exs. ὁ Ἐρατοσθένης  "Eratosthenes"; αἱ Ἀθῆναι "Athens" or with abstract nouns, ex. ἡ δημοκρατία "democracy"
- The article has "noun-making" powers: the article can be used with another part of speech, such as infinitives, participles, adjectives, and even particles, to create nouns or "substantives." We will see in more detail later in this module how it is used this way with adjectives.

### The article and attributive and predicate positions

As we will see in more detail as we continue this module, nouns can be modified in several ways. Word order of these modifiers in relation to the noun and its article can have an effect on meaning that we should pay attention to. Words can be placed between the article and noun to emphasize that those words are modifying the noun in particular ways. Or modifiers can be placed outside of the noun and its article to emphasize other kinds of relationships. These two different positions are called the **attributive** position and the **predicate** position.

**Attributive** position in ancient Greek follows the article that modifies the noun. The article can be repeated to create this position.So attributive position can look like any of the following

- ἡ μεγάλη γυνή  'the tall woman' 
- ἡ γυνὴ ἡ μεγάλη  'the tall woman'
- γυνὴ ἡ μεγάλη 'the tall woman'

    What nuance of emphasis might each of the three different ways of creating attributive position offer?

**Predicate** position is a placement outside of the article + noun phrase.

In the sections below on the genitive case, adjectives, and prepositions, pay attention to how these positions are used in different kinds of modifications of nouns.
