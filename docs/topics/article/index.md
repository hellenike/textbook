## The article 

English has a definite article, "the" and an indefinite article, "a" or "an." Ancient Greek has only one article, and its uses are both straightforward and subtle.


### The article and attributive and predicate positions

Nouns can be modified in several ways. 

Word order of these modifiers in relation to the noun and its article can have an effect on meaning that we should pay attention to. Words can be placed between the article and noun to emphasize that those words are modifying the noun in particular ways. Or modifiers can be placed outside of the noun and its article to emphasize other kinds of relationships. These two different positions are called the **attributive** position and the **predicate** position.




**Attributive** position in ancient Greek follows the article that modifies the noun. The article can be repeated to create this position. So attributive position can look like any of the following

- ἡ μεγάλη γυνή  'the tall woman' 
- ἡ γυνὴ ἡ μεγάλη  'the tall woman'
- γυνὴ ἡ μεγάλη 'the tall woman'

    What nuance of emphasis might you infer that each of the three different ways of creating attributive position offer?

**Predicate** position is a placement outside of the article + noun phrase.

In the sections below on the genitive case, adjectives, and prepositions, pay attention to how these positions are used in different kinds of modifications of nouns.
