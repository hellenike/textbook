## The nominative and genitive cases  


### The nominative case

The **nominative case** is a naming case. Its most frequent function is to indicate the subject of a finite verb. **Subject-verb agreement** means that the person and number of the subject must be the same as the person and number of the verb. So a *singular* noun in the nominative will have a third person *singular* verb form. In most cases, a nominative *plural* noun acting as the subject will  agree with a third person *plural* verb. Note, however, that in ancient Greek, *neuter* nominative *plural* nouns acting as the subject often take a third person *singular* verb form.

Consider these examples:

> ἡ μήτηρ ἐτελεύτησε, "His mother died."

ἡ μήτηρ is nominative, singular, and feminine, "his mother".  ἐτελεύτησε, "she died," is from τελευτάω, τελευτήσω, ἐτελεύτησα, τετελεύτηκα, τετελεύτημαι, ἐτελευτήθην, "to die." It is aorist, active and indicative; since it is in the third person singular, it *agrees* with the subject ἡ μήτηρ.


> τὸ παιδίον ἐβόα, "The baby was crying."

τὸ παιδίον, "the baby" is neuter nominative singular. ἐβόα, "It was crying," is from βοάω, βοήσω, ἐβόησα, βεβόηκα, βεβόημαι, ἐβοήθην, "to shout, cry," and is in the imperfect indicative active.  Because it is third person singular, it agrees with the subject τὸ παιδίον.

> ἐψόφουν αἱ θύραι, "The doors began to creak."

αἱ θύραι, "the doors," is feminine nominative *plural*. (We'll see the plural forms of the article and noun in this module.) ψοφέω "to make a noise" is a regular epsilon contract verb, so this form is the imperfect indicative active.  Since it is in the third person plural, it agrees with the subject αἱ θύραι.  (Note that subjects can follow the verb in Greek: its stil clear from its nominative case form that it functions as the subject of ἐψόφουν.)

> ταῦτα δίκαια ἦν, "These things were right."

ταῦτα is the neuter nominative plural of a pronoun we'll learn in this module, "this."  You've already learned that ἦν is an imperfect indicative active form of "to be."  It is third person singular:  since ταῦτα is *neuter* plural, the singular verb agrees with the plural subject. (δίκαια is an adjective we'll learn in this module, meaning "just, right.")

### The genitive case

The **genitive case** is used to relate one noun to another. (In fact, this is a feature of 
*all* the languages in the Indo-European family!)
While you may often find that  nouns in the genitive case are translated with the English preposition "of," it is important to understand the range of underlying ideas expressed by the genitive in ancient Greek.

### Some general uses of the genitive

- *Possession*: the genitive case represents the possessor of the other noun. In these instances, it might be translated into English with the preposition "of" or with the possessive marker "'s". Example: ἡ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς οἰκία "the house of the man" or "the man's house." Possessive genitives are usually placed in attributive position. 
- *Partitive genitive* or *Genitive of the whole*: the genitive expresses a group or a "whole" and the noun it is modifying is part of or one among that group. Example: ἡ βελτίστη γυνὴ πασῶν "the best wife of all." The partitive genitive is generally in the predicate position.
- *Subjective genitive* or *objective genitive*: when a noun is related to a verb, the genitive can express either the subject or the object of that verbal idea. Understanding the difference between them, even if the same phrasing is used to express each, allows for greater clarity. For example, in the English phrase "the fear of the Athenians," are the Athenians the ones fearing (subjective genitive) or the ones bring feared by someone else (objective genitive)? You would have to tell from context, and you can see that it does make a difference in meaning.
  - Subjective genitives, when the genitive is the "doer" of the implied action of the other noun, is usually in attributive position. Example: ἡ τοῦ παιδίου βοά "the cry of the baby" or "the baby's cry"
  - Objective genitives, when the genitive represents the object of the implied action, is usually in the predicate position. Example: πάντων τῶν κακῶν ἡ αἰτία "the cause of all my problems"

Other uses of the genitive we will meet later in this module, when the genitive is used with prepositions:
- *Motion away* or *separation*
- *Agent* of passive verbs

More uses will be introduced and discussed in future modules.
