## The nominative and genitive cases  


### Functions of the nominative and genitive

The **nominative case** is a naming case. Its most frequent function is to indicate the subject of a finite verb. **Subject-verb agreement** means that the person and number of the subject must be the same as the person and number of the verb. So a *singular* noun in the nominative will have a 3rd person *singular* verb form. In most cases, a nominative *plural* noun acting as the subject will  agree with a 3rd person *plural_*verb. Note, however, that in Ancient Greek, **neuter** nominative *plural* nouns acting as the subject often take a 3rd person &*singular* verb form.

The **genitive case** is used to relate one noun to another/make one noun depend on another. We often translate nouns in the genitive case with the English preposition "of." We will learn more about the range of functions of the genitive case later in this module.

### Forms of the nominative and genitive cases 

The case endings of nouns the singular nominative and genitive cases reflect both the noun's gender and what declension it belongs to.

#### First declension

> *Note on the persistent accent*: the first declension has one important exception to the expected position of the accent, in the genitive plural. The genitive plural ending of the first declension is always accented with a circumflex. There is a reason for this apparent exception, which has to do with the linguistic development of these forms over time: that circumflex reflects a vowel contraction similar to those you have seen in contract verbs.

Notice below that all the plural endings in this declension are the same, even with the variations in the singular.

For feminine first-declension nouns that end in -η

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -η | -αι |
| Genitive | -ης | -ῶν |

For feminine first-declension nouns that end in -ᾱ

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ᾱ | -αι |
| Genitive | -ᾱς | -ῶν |

For feminine first-declension nouns that end in -ᾰ

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ᾰ | -αι |
| Genitive | -ης | -ῶν |

For masculine first-declension nouns that end in -ης / -ᾱς

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ης / -ᾱς | -αι |
| Genitive | -ου | -ῶν |


#### Second declension

For masculine or feminine second-declension nouns that end in -ος

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ος | -οι |
| Genitive | -ου | -ων |

For neuter second-declension nouns that end in -ον

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ον | -ᾰ |
| Genitive | -ου | -ων |


#### Third declension

The third declension also contains nouns of all three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. The third declension is sometimes called the "consonant declension" because most nouns in this declension have stems ending in a consonant. Because of linguistic changes to different kinds of stems, a variety of patterns exists that you will need to become familiar with over time. Here we introduce just the basic pattern of endings that signify the third declension.

For masculine or feminine third-declension nouns:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ς or no ending | -ες  |
| Genitive | -ος  | -ων |

> Note that the *genitive* singular ending in this declension, -ος, is the same as the masculine or feminine ending of the *nominative* singular form in the second declension. That shows us that knowing what declension a noun belongs to, as well as what gender it is, is crucial for knowing what form the ending is indicating. 

For neuter third-declension nouns:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | - | -ᾰ |
| Genitive | -ος | -ων |

> Compare also the neuter nominative plural ending in both the second and third declensions, -ᾰ, and one of the feminine nominative singular forms in the first declension, also -ᾰ.



## The genitive case

In general, all the languages in the Indo-European family have use a genitive case to show a connection between one noun and another noun.  In this section, we start with some broad categories of connection that are represented by the genitive in ancient Greek. 

Notice that different uses may result in using similar words in English translation, such as "of": that coincidence provides ease of tranlsation, but we should nevertheless pay attention to what the relationship is. Translation of the genitive is also not *restricted* to using "of" and considering how English expresses that same relationship between nouns is a good habit to get into as you practice reading and translating.

### Some general uses of the genitive

- *Possession*: the genitive case represents the possessor of the other noun. As such, it can be translated into English with the preposition "of" or with the possessive marker "'s". Example: ἡ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς οἰκία "the house of the man" or "the man's house." Possessive genitives are usually placed in attributive position. 
- *Partitive genitive* or *Genitive of the whole*: the genitive expresses a group or a "whole" and the noun it is modifying is part of or one among that group. Example: ἡ βελτίστη γυνὴ πασῶν "the best wife of all." The partitive genitive is generally in the predicate position.
- *Subjective genitive* or *objective genitive*: when a noun is related to a verb, the genitive can express either the subject or the object of that verbal idea. Understanding the difference between them, even if the same phrasing is used to express each, allows for greater clarity. For example, in the English phrase "the fear of the Athenians," are the Athenians the ones fearing (subjective genitive) or the ones bring feared by someone else (objective genitive)? You would have to tell from context, and you can see that it does make a difference in meaning.
  - Subjective genitives, when the genitive is the "doer" of the implied action of the other noun, is usually in attributive position. Example: ἡ τοῦ παιδίου βοά "the cry of the baby" or "the baby's cry"
  - Objective genitives, when the genitive represents the object of the implied action, is usually in the predicate position. Example: πάντων τῶν κακῶν ἡ αἰτία "the cause of all my problems"

Other uses of the genitive we will meet later in this module, when the genitive is used with prepositions:
- *Motion away* or *separation*
- *Agent* of passive verbs

More uses will be introduced and discussed in future modules.
