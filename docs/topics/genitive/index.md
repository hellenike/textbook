## The article and the genitive case of nouns

The definite article is used so frequently in ancient Greek that it must and will become familiar, with its uses and nuances grasped with practice. Pronouns are also frequrntly used, and come in different types and uses that we will start, but not cover exhaustively, in this section.

### The article

English has a definite article, "the" and an indefinite article, "a" or "an." Ancient Greek has only the definite article, and its uses are both straightforward and subtle.

#### Forms of the article
The article modifying a noun agrees with it in gender, case, and number. There is a full paradigm of forms with all three genders in all cases and numbers, and it is important to learn to recognize these forms easily. Pay careful attention to and memorize the spelling, including accents and breathing marks, on these forms. There is no vocative form of the article.

| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem  | Neut | Masc | Fem  | Neut |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative | ὁ | ἡ | τό | οἱ | αἱ | τά |
| Genitive | τοῦ | τῆς | τοῦ | τῶν | τῶν | τῶν |
| Dative | τῷ | τῇ | τῷ | τοῖς | ταῖς | τοῖς |
| Accusative | τόν | τήν | τό | τούς | τάς | τά |

Note that the alpha in the neuter nominative and accusative plural form, τά, is a short alpha, while the alpha in the feminine accusative pliral form, τάς, is a long alpha.  


#### Some uses of the article

- Like the English definite article, the ancient Greek article may modify its noun by making it definite or particle: ἡ οἰκία "the house"
- Differently from English, however, the article may be used to denote a general class, οἱ ἄνθρωποι "people" or "humans." 
- Also differently from English, the article with a proper name, exs. ὁ Ἐρατοσθένης  "Eratosthenes"; αἱ Ἀθῆναι "Athens" or with abstract nouns, ex. ἡ δημοκρατία "democracy"
- The article has "noun-making" powers: the article can be used with another part of speech, such as infinitives, participles, adjectives, and even particles, to create nouns or "substantives." We will see in more detail later in this module how it is used this way with adjectives.

### The genitive case

As noted briefly above, the genitive case shows a connection between that noun and another noun. We can start with some broad categories of connection that are represented by the genitive.

#### Some general uses of the genitive

*Possession*: the genitive case represents the possessor of the other noun. As such, it can be translated into English with the preposition "of" or with the possessive marker "'s". Example: ἡ τοῦ
