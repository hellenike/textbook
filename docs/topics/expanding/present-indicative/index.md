## The present indicative

The present tense of the indicative describes actions that occur at the present time, with continuous or ongoing aspect. The stem is obtained by dropping the final -ω from the end of the first principal part; the accent is recessive. Its middle and passive forms are identical, but context will help you distinguish between the uses.
