## Further Adjective Declensions

### Third Declension Adjectives in -ής, -ές 

The adjectives ἀληθής, ἀληθές (‘true’) and ψευδής, ψευδές (‘false’) illustrate a common variation on third-declension adjective patterns. For both of these adjectives, the stem ends in an epsilon, which contracts with the ending when the ending begins with a vowel. (Historically, the adjective stem ended with a sigma, but this dropped out between vowels.) Again, if you recall patterns you have seen in epsilon contract verbs, you'll recognize the regular pattern beneath these surface forms: the genitive forms come frοm ἀληθε- plus the regular endings -ος (singular) and -ων (plural); the dative contracts from ἀληθε- plus the regular ending -ι, and the dative singular starts with the consonant -σι, so the epsilon of the stem is unaffected.  Accusative forms also come from regular endings. In the accusative singular of masculine and feminine forms, the regular ending -α contracts with epsilon to produce -η, while the plural ending -ες  contracts with epsilon and yields -εις (just like contract verbs).

Note that adjectives like ἀληθής, ἀληθές have only two sets of endings: one for both masculine and feminine forms, the other for neuter forms.

### Common slightly irregular 2-1-2 adjectives

Learn also the following three very common adjectives and their only slightly irregular declensions (they are mostly 2-1-2). Irregular forms are **emphasized** like this for your attention.

**ἄλλος, ἄλλη, ἄλλο**  _another, other_; with the article, _the rest_. Declines as a regular 2-1-2 adjective except for the neuter singular nominative and accusative, which is **ἄλλο** rather than the expected ἄλλον. Note that the accent on the penult distinguishes the neuter nominative/accusative plural ἄλλα from the conjunction ἀλλά (‘but’).

**μέγας, μεγάλη, μέγα** _big, large, great_. Note the irregular forms in the masculine and neuter nominative and accusative. Otherwise a 2-1-2 declension pattern with a persistent accent on the penult.

									
| Case  | M Singular	|	F Singular	|	N Singular	|	M Plural |		F Plural	|	N Plural |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative |	**μέγας** |	μεγάλη	| **μέγα**	|	μεγάλοι |	μεγάλαι |	μεγάλα	|						
| Genitive |	μεγάλου	| μεγάλης |	μεγάλου  |	μεγάλων |	μεγάλων | 	μεγάλων	|			
| Dative |	μεγάλῳ	| μεγάλῃ	|	μεγάλῳ |	μεγάλοις |	μεγάλαις |	μεγάλοις |
| Accusative |	**μέγαν** |	μεγάλην |	**μέγα** |		μεγάλους |	μεγάλας |	μεγάλα 	|	

**πολύς, πολλή, πολύ** _much, many_. Irregular forms also in the masculine and neuter nominative and accusative. Otherwise a 2-1-2 declension pattern with a persistent accent on the ultima.

								
| Case |	M Singular |	F Singular |	N Singular |	M Plural |	F Plural |	N Plural |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
