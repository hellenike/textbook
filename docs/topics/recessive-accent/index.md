## Recessive accent
Ancient Greek accents


General rules:
There are three types of accents: (1) acute ´   (2) grave `   (3) circumflex ˜ 

Accents are written over vowels. If a diphthong is accented, the accent is written over the second vowel of the diphthong (e.g., εὖ). In classical Greece the accent was a pitch accent: that is, the pitch of your voice would rise or lower. Because English speakers are accustomed to stress accents, we will stress any accented syllable, regardless of type of accent, when pronouncing a word.

Accents appear on only the last three syllables of a word, and almost every word will have an accent of some kind. These syllables are called 
		the antepenult (third from last)
		the penult (next to last) 
		the ultima (last) 

Some small words do not carry an accent: those that do not carry an accent or affect the accents of other words are called proclitics and are short words such as some forms of the article (ὁ, ἡ, οἱ, αἱ) and prepositions like εἰς, ἐκ, ἐν. There are also enclitics, short words that affect the accents of other words in a sentence but do not have their own accent.

Placement and type of accent depend on the length of vowels in the word. 
	Short vowels = α, ε, ι, ο, υ 
	Long vowels = α, η, ι, ω, υ. Diphthongs are long, expect for final –αι, -οι in some forms. 

An acute accent can appear on any of these syllables. It is the only accent that lives on the antepenult and can live there only if the ultima is short. Therefore, if the ultima has a long vowel or diphthong, the antepenult will not be accented.

A grave accent appears only on the ultima and only in a sentence: a grave accent replaces what would have been an acute accent on the ultima of a word followed directly (i.e., no punctuation intervenes) by another accented word in a sentence. This means that in a paradigm of noun, adjective, or verb forms you will not see or use a grave accent. It also means that the last word of a sentence does not have the change from acute to grave since no word follows without punctuation intervening.

A circumflex accent appears only on the penult or the ultima—never on the antepenult. It accents long vowels or diphthongs only. It will appear on the penult under the following circumstances: the penult is accented, the vowel or diphthong of the syllable is long, and the ultima is short—all of the conditions must be true and when they are true the accent must be a circumflex.



## Recessive accent

The accent on finite verb forms in ancient Greek is described as recessive, meaning the accent recedes as far back from the end of the word as the possible, in accordance with the set of rules governing accentuation.

The rules that apply to these forms:
1. The accent cannot recede further back than the antepenult. Therefore, the accent will reside on one of the last three syllables of a finite verb form, even if it has more than three syllables.

2. If the ultima is long, the accent recedes to the penult and is an acute accent on the penult.

3. If the ultima is short:[reminder that final -αι and -οι are usually short]
a. if there are three or more syllables in the form, the accent will recede to the antepenult and be an acute accent on that syllable.
b. if there are two syllables, the accent will be on the penult. Since the ultima is short, when the penult is accented its form will depend on the quantity of the penult syllable: if it is short, the accent will be acute. If it is long, the accent will be a circumflex.

Other situations with circumflex accents on finite verb forms:
4. As we learn contracted verb forms, where two vowels have combined to one sound, we will see circumflex accents mark those contractions when possible under the rules for circumflex accents. [do we explain compound verb forms yet? a couple of examples already in Lysias I.6]

5. If the verb form is only one syllable and it is long, it will carry a circumflex accent.


Practice for recessive accents:
On the following finite verb forms, determine the correct placement and type of accent in accordance with the rules of recessive accents, and then put it there. [Verb forms from Lysias I.6–11]
