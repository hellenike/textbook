## The relative pronoun



The relative pronoun is used to create dependent clauses that further describe or define a noun or pronoun in a sentence. The relative pronoun in English is *who, which,* or *that*. Relative clauses are dependent clauses, appearing with an independent clause in a sentence. The relative clause begins with a relative pronoun, which refers to a noun or pronoun in the independent clause, its *antecedent*. Because the relative clause is modifying that noun or pronoun, the form of the relative pronoun matches the antecedent in **gender** and **number**. Because the relative clause is its own verbal unit, with its own subject and verb, the **case** of the relative pronoun is determined by its use in its own clause. 

**Declension of ὅς, ἥ, ὅ**


| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem | Neut | Masc | Fem | Neut |
| Nominative | ὅς | ἥ | ὅ | οἵ | αἵ | ἅ |
| Genitive | οὗ | ἧς | οὗ | ὧν | ὧν | ὧν |
| Dative | ᾧ | ᾗ | ᾧ | οἷς | αἷς | οἷς  |
| Accusative | ὅν | ἥν | ὅ  | οὕς | ἅς | ἅ |

> Notes on the forms of ὅς, ἥ, ὅ

- the forms of the relative pronoun are similar to those of the article, without the initial tau that the article has in most forms and with a rough breathing on all forms. Note the difference in the masculine nominative singular ὅς from the article ὁ. With forms of the relative pronoun like ἥ, οἵ, and αἵ, the only difference between the article and the relative pronoun is the accent on the relative pronoun form.
- the accent pattern is also like that of the article, and like a persistent accent on the ultima: acute on nominative and accusative forms and circumflex on genitive and dative forms.

#### Examples of relative clauses

Identify the relative pronoun in the following sentences. What is its antecedent? What are the boundaries or the relative clause (where does it begin and where does it end)? What form of the relative pronoun would be used in ancient Greek (what is the gender, case, and number)?

- The woman who goes to the market brought messages to my wife.
- The house that I own has two floors.
- The husband narrated to the jurors the events which occurred.
