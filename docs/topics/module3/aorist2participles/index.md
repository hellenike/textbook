## Second aorist participles

You have seen that some verbs use a second aorist for the active and middle voices.  You can recognize these verbs from the ending of their third principal part: -ον for verbs that include an active voice (like ἔλαβον from λαμβάνω), or -όμην for verbs that have a middle but no active voice (like ἐγενόμην from γίγνομαι).  

Recall that these verbs use the same endings for finite verbs as the imperfect tense. Analogously, when you form the active and middle voice participles of second aorist verbs, you use the same endings as the present participle.
