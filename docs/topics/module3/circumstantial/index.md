## Participles: circumstantial participles

### Subordinated verbal ideas in English

English loves to use subordinate clauses as a way to describe the circumstances around the action of a clause.  Consider these examples from Caroline Falkner's translation of Lysias 1.

The circumstance might primarily be about time.

>When my mother died,  her passing proved to be the cause of all my problems.

> By keeping watch for the times when our slave girl went to market and by propositioning her, he corrupted her.

The first example refers to a single, specific event; the second refers to the habitual practice of the slave girl. Both use the English conjunction "when."


We can also add descriptive detail, like this example:

> I have a modest, two storey house, which has equal space for the women’s and men’s quarters on the upper and lower floors.

We can use subordinate clauses to express causation ("because...")

> The infant was being deliberately provoked by our slave girl into behaving like this because that individual was in the house.


We can use subordinate clauses to offer a contrast ("although"):

> I noticed though, gentlemen, that her face was made up,although her brother had died not thirty days earlier.

You could easily extend this list, but these examples are enough to make a remarkable point:  in each of these passages, Falkner is translating a Greek participle.


### Syntax and meaning of circumstantial participles

When participles are *not* tied directly to a noun by being placed in attributive position, they express an attendant circumstance of any kind.  Like attributive participles, they will agree with a noun or pronoun in the sentence that functions as the subject of the its verbal idea, but the meaning of the participle's verbal unit will apply to the clause's verbal action rather than more narrowly defining the noun.


Let's look first at a minimal example. When Euphiletos tells his wife to go take care of their baby, she puts him off by saying: "You tried to grab her (the slave girl) before."  She shows that he didn't actually succeed by using the imperfect tense (εἷλκες); the direct object ("her") is a pronoun we'll learn in the next unit (αὐτήν); πρότερον is an adverb, "before", and the main clause is then πρότερον δὲ  εἷλκες αὐτήν. She adds to that clause a present participle of the verb μεθύω, "to be drunk": πρότερον δὲ  μεθύων εἷλκες αὐτήν. What does it mean?

μεθύων is maculine, nominative, singular so it agrees with the subject of the verb ("you," implied in the verb form).  It's present tense so it describes



Pres. ptcpl good for time/ongoing/circum: WHILE YOU WERE DRUNK. Or causal? ALL OF THE ABOVE!


FAST NARRATIVE

Aorist ptcpl good for rapid narration of successive events: TIME

ὤσαντες δὲ τὴν θύραν τοῦ δωματίου αὐτὸν  εἴδον
καὶ δᾷδας λαβόντες ἐκ τοῦ ἐγγύτατα καπηλείου εἰσερχόμεθα



οὐκ εἰσαρπασθεὶς ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ, οὐδ' ἐπὶ τὴν ἑστίαν καταφυγών


time, causal, manner, concessive




By lying:  MANNER

ψευδόμενοι

ALL OF IT

οἱ τὰ ἄδικα πράττοντες ψευδόμενοι καὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα μηχανώμενοι ὀργὰς τοῖς ἀκούουσι κατὰ τῶν τὰ δίκαια πραττόντων παρασκευάζουσι

people who commit crimes do not admit when their enemies are speaking the truth, but make up lies and invent stories to make their listeners angry at those who are acting within their rights



ὤσαντες δὲ τὴν θύραν τοῦ δωματίου οἱ μὲν πρῶτοι εἰσιόντες ἔτι εἴδομεν  κατακείμενον παρὰ τῇ γυναικί,



> ὀργὰς 
>> τοῖς ἀκούουσι 
>>> κατὰ τῶν τὰ δίκαια πραττόντων 
> παρασκευάζουσι
