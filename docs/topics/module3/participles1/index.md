## Participles: introduction

In Module 1, we looked at an essential kind of verbal unit, the clause.  Recall that every clause has a finite verb (expressed or implied); explicit subjects of finite verbs are in the nominative case.

A second essential kind of verbal unit is the **participle**.  The participial forms of a verb may be transitive,
intransitive, or a linking verb, exactly like the finite forms of the same verb.  Like finite verb forms, participles also have tense and voice.  The relation of the participle to the subject of the verbal action is expressed differently, however. The participle is always associated with a noun in the clause, and agrees with that noun in gender, case and number, just like adjectives.  This is why the ancient Greek grammatical term for "participle," is μετοχή, literally  "a sharing:" participles share have some of the properties of a finite verb (tense, voice) and some of the properties of an adjective (gender, case, number).



πάντων τῶν κακῶν ἀποθανοῦσα αἰτία μοι γεγένηται




While English also has adjectives derived from verbs that we call "participles," the Greek participle is used quite differently.  It will be more helpful think of the participle that, like the clause, always has a subject and verbal action.  






Like finite verbs, participles have tense and voice. Like any other adjective, participles have gender, case and number, and agree with the noun they describe in all those properties. But like other verb forms, participles have tense and voice, and function alongside finite verbs as a second kind of verbal unit.



### English participles

English has a very limited set of participles.  We can add *ing* to a verb stem to create a participle in a present tense and active voice.  In a phrase like the cliché "babbling brook "brook" is a noun described by the adjective "babbling". "Babbling" is a participle in the active voice: we're saying that "the brook babbles."  It's also in the present tense: the brook is babbling as we speak.

We can also add *ed* to a verb stem to create a participle in a past tense and passive voice.  The phrase "dreaded news" describes the noun "news" with an adjective made from the verb "to dread".  The voice is passive: the news is not the active subject dreading something, but the passive subject, the thing that is dreaded.  The tense is past: the news was already dreaded before we speak.


### Participles in Greek

Like finite verbs, participles are a verbal unit.  That is, they express a verbal idea with a subject.  Finite verbs 







You've seen that the subject of finite verb may be implied by the person and number of the verb form ("he" or "she for example, could be the subject of a third singular form), and that expressed subjects of finite verbs are in the nominative case.

The subject of a participle is a noun or pronoun
