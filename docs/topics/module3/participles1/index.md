## Participles: introduction

In Module 1, we looked at an essential kind of verbal unit, the clause.  Recall that every clause has a finite verb (expressed or implied), and that explicit subjects of finite verbs are in the nominative case.

A second essential kind of verbal unit in Greek is the **participle**.  Participles may have exactly the same kinds of objects or predicates as finite verb forms, depending on whether the verb transitive, intransitive, or a linking verb.  The relation of the participle to the subject of the verbal action is expressed differently, however. The participle always agrees with a noun or pronoun in the clause in gender, case and number, just like adjectives.  This noun or pronoun functions as the subject of the participle's action.  

Participles express 



Like finite verb forms, participles have tense and voice.  


This is why the ancient Greek grammatical term for "participle," is μετοχή, literally  "a sharing:" participles share some of the properties of a finite verb (tense, voice), and some of the properties of an adjective (gender, case, number).
