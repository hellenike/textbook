## First aorist participles

You have learned that finite verb forms add an augment to the beginning of the form for tenses referring to past time.  Recall that the first principal does *not* include an augment, while the third and sixth principal parts *do*, so when you form the imperfect tense, you need to add an augment to the  first principal part's stem.

Augments are *only used in finite forms*, so when we form the aorist participles from the third principal part (active and middle voices) and sixth principal part (passive voice), the first step is to remove the augment, and drop the first singular ending.

### Active voice of first aorists: a 3-1-3 declension

We use the third principal part for aorist active forms.  Taking κελεύω as an example, we would form the aorist active participle in these three steps:

1. Remove the augment and accent 
2. For masculine and neuter forms, create a *third-declension* stem with nominative singular/genitive  singular ending **-ας**, **-αντος**  (masculine) or **-αν, -αντος**  (neuter); for feminine forms, create a *first-declension* stem with nominative singular/genitive  singular ending  **-ασα, -άσης**
3. As always, get the stem from the genitive singular, and add the regular ending from the third (masculine, neuter) or first (feminine) declension to match the gender, case and number of the participle's subject.
4. Apply the appropriate accent.  

> Notice the parallel to the formation of finite verb forms:  the stem tells you the *tense and voice*; then for finite verbs, the ending shows the person, number and mood, while for participles, the ending shows gender, case and number.

Here is a complete declension of the aorist active participle of κελεύω.

| Case, number | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Singular** | | | |
| Nominative singular | κελεύσᾱς | κελεύσασα | κέλευσαν | 
| Genitive singular | κελεύσαντος  | κελευσάσης   | κελεύσαντος | 
| Dative singular | κελεύσαντι | κελευσάσῃ  | κελεύσαντι | 
| Accusative singular | κελεύσαντα | κελεύσασαν | κέλευσαν | 
| **Plural** | | | |
| Nominative plural | κελεύσαντες | κελεύσασαι| κελεύσαντα | 
| Genitive plural | κελευσάντων  | κελευσασῶν  | κελευσάντων | 
| Dative plural | κελεύσασι, κελεύσασιν  | κελευσάσαις   | κελεύσασι, κελεύσασιν | 
| Accusative plural | κελεύσαντας  | κελεύσασας | κελεύσαντα | 


#### An example

We'll devote much of this module to looking at how participles are used, but let's look at one concrete example.

The clause εἶδε ἐρατοσθένην ("He saw Eratosthenes) is a complete sentence.  The verb form is third person singular aorist indiciative active ("he saw"), and the direct object ("Eratosthenes") is in the masculine accusative singular.  Let's modify this sentence to add a subordinate idea, that Eratosthenes did these things.  In English, we could do that with a subordinate clause:

> He saw Eratosthenes,
>
>> who did these things.


In Greek, our main clause will be εἶδε ἐρατοσθένην.  We'll express the subordinate idea with a participle from πράττω.  


To form the participle, we'll take the third principal part, and remove accent and augment

(1) ἔπραξα -> πραξ-

We'll be using a masculine form to agree with Eratosthenes, so let's form a third-declension pattern:

(2) πραξ- -> πραξας, πραξαντος

Now we will use the genitive singular to find the stem, and add the masculine, accusative, singular ending for the third-declension :

(3) πραξαντος -> πραξαντ + α

Finally, we'll apply the accent.  The accent of the aorist active participle tries to persist on the *antepenult* (so it behaves as if the accent is recessive).

(4) πραξαντ + α -> πράξαντα 



We want to attach the participle to Eratosthenes because he will be the subject of the subordinate verbal unit.  We'll look in  detail at how to attach participles to nouns, but for this example let's just put it in attributive position after the article: τὸν  πράξαντα.  Just like finite verb forms, participles can have direct objects, so we'll include the direct object "these things" within the attributive phrase: τὸν ταῦτα πράξαντα.  Here's our complete sentence:



> **εἶδε** ἐρατοσθένην
> 
> >  τὸν ταῦτα **πράξαντα**.


The first verbal unit is an independent clause with the finite verb εἶδε; the second verbal unit is a participial expression. The subject of εἶδε is third singular (implied "he, she, it").  The subject of πράξαντα is ἐρατοσθένην (agreement in gender, case number).  Together they express the equivalent of the English "He saw Eratosthenes, who did these things."




### Middle voice of first aorists: a 2-1-2 declension

Follow a similar process to form the aorist middle participle:



1. Remove the augment and accent 
2. For all three genders, extend the stem with -αμεν-
3. Add regular ending from second third (masculine, neuter) or first (feminine) declension to match the gender, case and number of the participle's subject.
4. Apply the appropriate accent.  



Here is a complete declension of the aorist middle participle of κελεύω.

| Case, number | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Singular** | | | |
| Nominative singular | κελευσάμενος  | κελευσαμένη | κελευσάμενον | 
| Genitive singular | κελευσαμένου  | κελευσαμένης   | κελευσαμένου | 
| Dative singular | κελευσαμένῳ | κελευσαμένῃ  | κελευσαμένῳ | 
| Accusative singular | κελευσάμενον | κελευσαμένην | κελευσάμενος | 
| **Plural** | | | |
| Nominative plural | κελεύσαντες | κελεύσασαι| κελεύσαντα | 
| Genitive plural | κελευσάντων  | κελευσασῶν  | κελευσάντων | 
| Dative plural | κελεύσασι, κελεύσασιν  | κελευσάσαις   | κελεύσασι, κελεύσασιν | 
| Accusative plural | κελεύσαντας  | κελεύσασας | κελεύσαντα | 



### Passive voice: a 3-1-3 declension

The aorist passive participle, like the finite forms of the aorist passive tense, is formed from the sixth principal part. It uses third-declension endings for the masculine and neuter forms, and first-declension endings for feminine forms.  Compare the patterns of nominative/genitive singular in -είς/-έντος, -εῖσα/-είσης, -έν/-έντος  with the aorist active pattern -ας/-αντος, -ασα/άσης, -αν/-αντος.

The accent of the aorist passive participle is persistent on the first syllable of the ending.



1. Remove the augment and accent 
2. For masculine and neuter forms, create a *third-declension* stem with nominative singular/genitive  singular ending **-είς**, **-έντος**  (masculine) or **-έν, -έντος**  (neuter); for feminine forms, create a *first-declension* stem with nominative singular/genitive  singular ending  **-εῖσα, -είσης**
3. Add regular ending from second third (masculine, neuter) or first (feminine) declension to match the gender, case and number of the participle's subject.
4. Apply the appropriate accent.  


| Case, number | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Singular** | | | |
| Nominative singular | κελευσθείς  | κελευσθεῖσα | κελευσθέν | 
| Genitive singular | κελευσθέντος   | κελευσθείσης    | κελευσθέντος | 
| Dative singular | κελευσθέντι | κελευσθείσῃ  | κελευσθέντι | 
| Accusative singular | κελευσθέντα | κελευσθεῖσαν | κελευσθέν | 
| **Plural** | | | |
| Nominative plural | κελευσθέντες | κελευσθεῖσαι| κελευσθέντα | 
| Genitive plural | κελευσθέντων  | κελευσθεισῶν  | κελευσθέντων | 
| Dative plural | κελευσθεῖσι, κελευσθεῖσιν  | κελευσθείσαις   | κελευσθεῖσι, κελευσθεῖσιν | 
| Accusative plural | κελευσθέντας  | κελεύσασας | κελευσθείσας |
