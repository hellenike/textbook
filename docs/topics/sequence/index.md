## Sequence of Moods: Overview

The term "Sequence of Moods" describes the relationship between the tense/mood of a sentence's main verb and the mood of the verb in a subordinate clause.

The sequence is called either "Primary" or "Secondary." Primary tenses of verbs are those that express action in the present or future, while secondary tenses are those that express action in the past. The subjunctive mood is associated with the primary tenses. The optative mood is associated with the secondary tenses.

| Sequence | Tense of the main verb | Mood of the verb in subordinate clause |
| --- | --- | ---|
| Primary | Present, Future, or Perfect | Subjunctive |
| Secondary | Imperfect, Aorist, or Pluperfect | Optative |
