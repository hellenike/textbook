## Adjectives: full declensions




#### Examples of adjective declension

Many three-ending adjectives are what we call "first and second declension" adjectives because the feminine forms use first declensions case endings while the masculine and neuter forms use second declension case endings. A representative example of these adjectives is ἀγαθός, ἀγαθή, ἀγαθόν. An English translation for this adjective is "good," and like "good" in English, there is a range of ways people or things can be ἀγαθός, ἀγαθή, ἀγαθόν. As you see this adjective in your readings, what nuances of meaning does the context give to this adjective?

| Accusative | ἀγαθόν | ἀγαθήν | ἀγαθόν | ἀγαθούς  | ἀγαθάς  | ἀγαθά  |

Other adjectives are called "first and third declension" adjectives because the feminine forms belong to the first declension while the masculine and neuter belong to the third declension. As we have already seen with verb principal parts, the more common an adjective is, the more likely it is to be "irregular" in its forms. The most common irregular adjective in our readings this year will be the adjective πᾶς, πᾶσα, πᾶν, and its compound form ἅπας, ἅπασα, ἅπαν. The English equivalents, depending on the particular use in context, include "all," "every" and "whole." That is, both adjectives indicate a completeness or entirety, and ἅπας, ἅπασα, ἅπαν emphasizes that quality even more. They decline the same way, although note the difference in persistent accent between the two.
