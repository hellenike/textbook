## The *imperfect indicative*

The imperfect indicative is another way of narrating factual events in the past. 
As we have seen, the aorist views an action as a single action completed in the past. 
The imperfect, by contrast, expresses an action that is incomplete, repeated, continuous or ongoing, habitual, or in some other way *not* viewed as single and complete. To express similar ideas, English uses additional "helping" verbs: "she was going," "he started to go," "they used to go."


### Forming the imperfect indicative of -ω or thematic verbs

- all three voices use the *first* principal part, with the addition of an **augment**
- middle and passive voices have identical forms in this tense

**Augment**:
Past tenses in the indicative mood are indcated by two features: their set of personal endings, and an *augment* at the front of the verb stem.
Compare first and third parts of verbs you already know. The aorist indicative (third prinicipal part) is characterized by adding an epsilon to the first prinicipal part's stem. If the stem begins with a consonant, you will see the epsilon in front of it. If the stem begins with a vowel, you will see that vowel lengthened. Either of these is called an *augment*. The imperfect tense shows the same pattern, but uses the first principal part. So when you need to add an augment, look to the third prinicpal part to see what it should be. 

- (1) start by removing the first person singular ending (-ω or -ομαι) and accent from the first principal part, and add the augment 

> γίγνομαι -> ἐγιγν- (Remember that for a verb whose first principal part has a middle ending, you will use only middle endings in the imperfect.
>
> κελεύω -> ἐκελευ-
>
> ἔρχομαι -> ἠρχ-
>
> ἄγω -> ἠγ-


- (2) Add appropriate ending.  For today, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural.

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle and Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  -ε | -ετο |
| 3rd plural | -ον | -οντο |


- (3) Apply recessive accent.  

Example of κελεύω "command"

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle and Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἐκέλευε  | ἐκελεύετο |
| 3rd plural | ἐκέλευον | ἐκελεύοντο |

The imperfect indicative active could be translated into English as "she/he/it was commanding" or "he/she/it used to command" (3rd singular) or "they were commanding" (3rd plural).

The imperfect indicative middle would add to the active sense that the subject was giving these commands for their own benefit or interests.

The imperfect indicative passive means that the subject is now the one receiving the orders: "he/she it was being commanded" or "they were being commanded."


### Forming the imperfect indicative of -μι or athematic verbs like δείκνυμι 

When we practiced aorist forms, the third principal part of the verb δείκνυμι ("to show, demonstrate"), ἔδειξα, indicated that its forms were like that of any first aorist. Since the imperfect is formed from the first principal part, we will notice that δείκνυμι belongs to a different conjugation than our -ω or thematic verbs for forms made from this principal part. The meaning and usage of the imperfect indicative, in all three voices, remains the same, it is simply formed slightly differently. 

As with -ω/thematic verbs, for the imperfect indicative of -μι/athematic verbs:

- all three voices use the *first* principal part, with the addition of an **augment**
- middle and passive voices have identical forms in this tense

- (1) start by removing the first person singular ending (-μι or -μαι) and accent from the first principal part, and add the augment 

> δείκνυμι  -> ἐδεικνυ-


- (2) Add appropriate ending.  For today, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural. The key difference in the endings is that they do not include the _thematic_ vowel (hence the name of the conjugation "athematic").

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle and Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  — | -το |
| 3rd plural | -ν | -ντο |


- (3) Apply recessive accent.  

Example of δείκνυμι "show, demonstrate"

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle and Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἔδεικνυ  | ἐδείκνυτο  |
| 3rd plural | ἔδεικνυν  | ἐδείκνυντο  |

To repoeat, the meaning and usage of these forms is the same. Thus the imperfect indicative active could be translated into English as "she/he/it was showing" or "he/she/it used to show" (3rd singular) or "they were showing" (3rd plural).

The imperfect indicative middle would add to the active sense that the subject was showing for their own benefit or interests.

The imperfect indicative passive means that the subject is now the one receiving the orders: "he/she it was being shown" or "they were being shown."
