## The imperfect indicative

The imperfect indicative is another way of narrating factual events in the past. 
As we have seen, the aorist views an action as a single action completed in the past. 
The imperfect, by contrast, expresses an action that is incomplete, repeated, continuous or ongoing, habitual, or in some other way *not* viewed as single and complete. To express similar ideas, English uses additional "helping" verbs: "she was going," "he started to go," "they used to go."


### Forming the imperfect indicative of -ω or thematic verbs

You form all three voices of the imperfect tense from the *first* principal part.  As with the aorist, you will drop the first-person ending, remove accents, and add the appropriate ending for the person and number you want. For the imperfect tense, you also add a prefix called the **augment**.


**Augment**:  Past tenses in the indicative mood are indcated by two features: their set of personal endings, and an *augment* at the front of the verb stem. Compare the first and third parts of verbs you already know. The third principal part (used for the aorist active and middle) is generally characterized by adding an epsilon to the first prinicipal part's stem. If the stem begins with a consonant, you will see the epsilon in front of it. If the stem begins with a vowel, you will see that vowel lengthened. Either of these changes is called an *augment*. The imperfect tense shows the same pattern, but uses the first principal part. So when you need to add an augment, look to the third principal part to see what it should be. 

- (1) start by removing the first person singular ending (-ω or -ομαι) and accent from the first principal part, and add the augment 

> κελεύω -> ἐκελευ-
>  
> γίγνομαι -> ἐγιγν- (Remember that for a verb whose first principal part has a middle ending, you will use only middle endings in the imperfect.
>
> ἔρχομαι -> ἠρχ-
>
> ἄγω -> ἠγ-


- (2) Add the appropriate ending.  For today, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural.  Note that in *all* person-number combinations of the imperfect indicative, the middle and passive have identical endings.

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle ending | Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  -ε | -ετο | -ετο |
| 3rd plural | -ον | -οντο | -οντο |


- (3) Apply recessive accent.  

Example of κελεύω "command"

| Person and Number | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἐκέλευε  | ἐκελεύετο | ἐκελεύετο |
| 3rd plural | ἐκέλευον | ἐκελεύοντο | ἐκελεύοντο |

Depending on the context, these third person imperfect indicative active verb forms could mean "she/he/it was commanding" or "he/she/it used to command" (3rd singular) or "they were commanding" (3rd plural), etc.

The imperfect indicative middle would add to the active sense that the subject was giving these commands for their own benefit or interests or to themselves.

The imperfect indicative passive means that the subject is now the one receiving the orders: "he/she/it was being commanded" or "they were being commanded," etc.



### Forming the imperfect indicative of -μι or athematic verbs like δείκνυμι 


When we learned aorist forms, the third principal part of the verb δείκνυμι ("to show, demonstrate"), ἔδειξα, indicated that its forms were like that of any other first aorist. Since the imperfect is formed from the first principal part, we will notice that δείκνυμι belongs to the group of -μι verbs (or athematic verbs), rather than the -ω or thematic verbs. The meaning, usage, and formation of the imperfect indicative remains the same; the only difference is that -μι verbs use a slightly different set of endings.

As with -ω/thematic verbs, for the imperfect indicative of -μι/athematic verbs, all three voices use the *first* principal part, with the addition of an **augment**, and the middle and passive voices have identical forms in this tense.

- (1) start by removing the first person singular ending (-μι or -μαι) and accent from the first principal part, and add the augment 

> δείκνυμι  -> ἐδεικνυ-


- (2) Add appropriate ending.  In this module, you should memorize the *third person* endings for singular and plural. The key difference in the endings is that they do not include the *thematic* vowel (hence the name of the conjugation *athematic*).

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle ending | Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  — | -το | -το |
| 3rd plural | -ν | -ντο | -ντο |


- (3) Apply recessive accent.  

Example of δείκνυμι "show, demonstrate" (note that the upsilon is a long upsilon)

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle ending | Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἐδείκνυ  | ἐδείκνυτο  | ἐδείκνυτο |
| 3rd plural | ἐδείκνυν  | ἐδείκνυντο  | ἐδείκνυντο |

To repeat, the meaning and usage of these forms is the same. The range of meaning for the active forms could include "she/he/it was showing" or "he/she/it used to show" (3rd singular) or "they were showing" (3rd plural), etc.

The imperfect indicative middle would add to the active sense that the subject was showing for their own benefit or interests.

The imperfect indicative passive means that the subject is now the one receiving the action: "he/she it was being shown" or "they were being shown."
