(Question for Neel: Do we do aorist first? That seems to introduce the idea of "verbal units" so I am assuming that comes before this.)
## The *imperfect indicative*

The imperfect indicative is another way of narrating factual events in the past. 
As we have seen, the aorist indicate views an action as a single action completed in the past. 
The imperfect, by contrast, expresses an action that is incomplete, repeated, continuous or ongoing, habitual, or in some other way *not* viewed as single and complete. To express similar ideas, English uses additional "helping" verbs: "she was going," "he started to go," "they used to go"


### Forming the imperfect indicative

- all three voices use the *first* principal part, with the addition of an augment
- middle and passive voices have identical forms

Augment:
Past tenses in the indicative mood are indcated by two features: their set of personal endings, and an *augment* at the front of the verb stem.
Compare first and third parts of verbs you already know.  The aorist indicative (third prinicipal part) is characterized by adding an epsilon to the first prinicipal part's stem. If the stem begins with a consonant, you will see the epsilon in front of it. If the stem begins with a vowel, you will see that vowel .  This is called *augment*.  The imperfect tense shows the same pattern, but uses the first principal part. So when you need to add an augment, look to the third prinicpal part to see what it should be. 

- (1) start by removing the first person singular ending (-ω or  and accent from the first principal part 

> ἔδειξα -> ἐδειξ-
>
> ἐκέλευσα -> ἐκελευσ-

- (2) Add appropriate ending.  For today, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural.

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  -ε | -ατο |
| 3rd plural | -ᾰν | -αντο |
