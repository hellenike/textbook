# The imperfect indicative

Meaning:

- contrasts with the aorist: expresses an action that is incomplete, repeated, continuous or in some other way *not* viewed as single and complete.

Form:

- all three voices use the *first* principal part
- middle and passive voices have identical forms

Augment:

- compare first and third parts of verbs you already know.  The aorist indicative is characterized by adding an epsilon to the first part's stem.  This is called *augment*.  
- The imperfect tense shows the same pattern, but uses the first principal part.
