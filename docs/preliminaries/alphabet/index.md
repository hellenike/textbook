## The Greek alphabet


### Overview

Notes for overview:

- the form of the Greek alphabet we use evolved over many centuries
- memorize the alphabet in alphabetical order so you can use a dictionary
- practice reading aloud until you are comfortable pronouncing Greek words you have not seen before


### The basic letters

## Breathings
Another sound to add: words beginning with a vowel will have what is called a breathing mark written over that vowel. There are two kinds of breathing marks:
smooth breathing looks like this ’ and adds no sound to the vowel
rough breathing looks like this ‘ and adds an ‘h’ sound to the vowel (words beginning with a rho also have a rough breathing, making it an ‘rh’ sound)

## Diphthongs
Diphthongs are combinations of two vowels that result in one syllable. English has them, too. In Greek, diphthongs are combinations of iota or upsilon with other vowels. 

diphthong |	pronunciation guide	|  model Greek word
--- | --- | ---
αι 	|	    **ai**sle		  |	      αἰδώς (“sense of shame, respect”) 
αυ 	|	    h**ou**se, pl**ow**		|        αὔριον (“tomorrow”) 
ει 	|	    w**ei**gh			    |        εἰρήνη (“peace”)
ευ 	|	    ε + υ 			  |        εὖ (“well,” the adverb of “good”) 
οι 	|	    c**oi**n			    |        οἰκία (“house, home”) 
ου 	|	    s**ou**p, b**oo**t		|        οὐρανός (“sky”) 
υι 	|	    **wi**t			      |        υἱός (“son”)

Accents and breathing marks are written over the second vowel of a diphthong.

### Iota subscript
When iota combines with long alpha, eta, or omega, one modern convention is to write it beneath the vowel as an “iota subscript,” which look like this:   ᾳ, ῃ, ῳ
Some guides suggest pronouncing such combinations as a diphthong; in practice, I will not. But in writing the iota subscript is absolutely essential and cannot be ignored. [[Neel and Mary differ on pronunication]]





### A few further details

A few details to note:

- "rough breathing" spells out when words spelled with an initial vowel start with an "h-" sound
- sigma changes form at the end of a word but is not pronounced differently
- "iota subscript" became an alternate way of spelling a final iota when the final iota began to be dropped in pronounciation. (You could think of it as similar to using an apostrophe when you write a contraction like "don't" in English, but we'll make a habit of pronouncing the iota subscript.)



Tips:

- read out loud (as the ancient Greeks did!)
- we can't precisely recover ancient pronounciation, but try to distinguish sounds that are spelled differently (e.g., ο/ω ε/η ), and include accent in your pronounciation.  Hear the difference between ἀστραπηβόλος, "one who throws lightning" (an adjective describing Zeus) and ἀστραπήβολος  "one struck by lightning". It makes a difference! English similarly distinguishes otherwise identical words based on (stress) accent. How does the way you pronounce the following English word change their meaning? content, present, object, insult, permit



Practice reading these words out loud:


- Ἐρατοσθένης  (name of the murdered man in Lysias, *Oration 1*)
- Εὐφίλητος (name of the man accused of murder)
- Σώστρατος (name of a friend of Εὐφίλητος)
- Ἀθηναῖοι
