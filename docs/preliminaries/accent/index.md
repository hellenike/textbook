## Ancient Greek accents (τόνος)

Classical Greek was spoken with a pitch accent: that is, the pitch of your voice would rise or fall on different syllables. Later, this evolved into a stress accent: as in English or modern Greek, accented syllables came to be pronounced instead with extra stress.  Ancient scholars worried about tghe "correct" pronounciation as pitch accent began to disappear, and devised a system of three accent marks to indicate the proper pitch for a syllable. Their word for these accents, τόνος, was also used to refer to systems of pitch in Greek music, and is the source of the English word "tone."

The *acute* accent **´** indicated that your voice should rise on the accented syllable, and was called ὀξύτονον, the sharp or high pitch.  The *grave* accent  **`** indicated that the voice should fall.  It was called the βαρύτονον, the heavy or low pitch. The *circumflex*  **˜**  signaled that your voice should rise and then fall on a single syllable. Its name was the περισπόμενος τόνος, a pitch that is bent or wrapped around as it travels up and then down.

Because English speakers are accustomed to stress accents, we will pronounce any accented syllable, regardless of type of accent, with a stress accent.
 
### Practice

Practice pronouncing the following words. As you'll learn in Module 2, Greek nouns change their endings to indicate their function. Each 
pair of words shows two forms of the same noun: pronounce them so that you can hear clearly which syllable is stressed in each instance.

- Εὐφίλητος (name of the man accused of murder)
- Εὐφιλήτου
- Ἀθηναῖοι (Athenians)
- Ἀθηναίους
- πολίτης (the word for citizen of a city-state, compare English "political")
- πολιτῶν 


### General rules

Accents are written over vowels. If a diphthong is accented, the accent is written over the second vowel of the diphthong (e.g., εὖ). 

Accents appear on only the last three syllables of a word, and almost every word will have an accent of some kind. These syllables are called 


- 	the *ultima* (last syllable) 
-	the *penult* (the penultimate, or next to last, syllable) 
-	the *antepenult* (the one before the penult, or third from last)


Some small words do not carry an accent: those that do not carry an accent or affect the accents of other words are called *proclitics* and are short words such as some forms of the article (ὁ, ἡ, οἱ, αἱ) and prepositions like εἰς, ἐκ, ἐν. There are also *enclitics*, short words that affect the accents of other words in a sentence but do not have their own accent.

Placement and type of accent depend on the length of vowels in the word. 

	Short vowels = α, ε, ι, ο, υ 
	Long vowels = α, η, ι, ω, υ. Diphthongs are long, expect for final –αι, -οι in some forms. 

An acute accent can appear on any of these syllables. It is the only accent that lives on the antepenult and can live there only if the ultima is short. Therefore, if the ultima has a long vowel or diphthong, the antepenult will not be accented.

A grave accent appears only on the ultima and only in a sentence: a grave accent replaces what would have been an acute accent on the ultima of a word followed directly (i.e., no punctuation intervenes) by another accented word in a sentence. This means that in a paradigm of noun, adjective, or verb forms you will not see or use a grave accent. It also means that the last word of a sentence does not have the change from acute to grave since no word follows without punctuation intervening.

A circumflex accent appears only on the penult or the ultima—never on the antepenult. It accents long vowels or diphthongs only. It will appear on the penult under the following circumstances: the penult is accented, the vowel or diphthong of the syllable is long, and the ultima is short—all of the conditions must be true and when they are true the accent must be a circumflex.
