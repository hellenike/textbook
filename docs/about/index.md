## Organization

After a brief section of "Preliminaries" introducing the Greek alphabet and accent, the chapters of this textbook introducing students to ancient Greek correspond to modules that we use as the basis for two to three weeks of our courses.  We expect to cover modules 1-4 together in the first semester of a two-semester, full-year course.  

Each of these chapters has three sections:

1.  *language*: introduction of new features of the Greek language
2. *ancient Greek in action*: each module includes some reading or activites that ask students to relate content introducted in the language section of this module to some aspect of their life
3. *reading*: a minimally modified passage from the target text (in this edition, Lysias 1).  This passage is the basis of an assignment we include in the section of the "Practice" chapter for this module.

These chapters are followed by sections of the textbook with practice and review material for each module. In the "practice" section, we include for each module some short excercises using forms and syntax from that module, and structured series of three assignments that we incorporate in our course.  These series progress from an exercise to solidy mastery of basic forms and syntax, to an analysis and translation of the reading passage for the module, to a guided composition.

The "review" chapter includes summaries of forms and syntax and a list of required vocabulary.

Finally, a reference section, offers a more comprehensive summary of forms.


### NOTE ON Vocabulary: TBA



First half of course: emphasis on a small core vocabulary (perhaps < 200 words).  This vocabulary is defined by comparison with other Greek corpora, and finding shared items in the highest frequency lists of individual corpora (rather than the common practice of finding most frequent terms in a *composite* list:  this effaces the differences in vocabulary from one corpus to another).

It includes:

- function words (prepositions, particles, conjunctions)
- the article and pronouns
- a small core of extremely common verbs, especially those which have a large number of compounds.  In counting the frequency of a simplex verb like φέρω, we include occurrences of compounds such as ἐπιφέρω or ἐκφέρω.

It includes a relatively small number of nouns, and fewer adjectives:  these parts of speech vary more from one corpus to another.


In the second half of the course, we focus on a second vocabulary tier:  terms that are frequent in the target corpus and related or similar texts, but not necessarily in other Greek corpora.  The goal is to have a large enough vocabulary to recognize 75-90% of the lexical items in the target text, excluding proper nouns and adjectives.  For some target texts, a vocabulary of < 500 words may be adequate.  This second vocabulary tier will include more verbs, a larger number of nouns, and some additional adjectives.
