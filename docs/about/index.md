## Content

- targetted to a specific text or corpus
- covers only features of language found in the target texts

## Organization

Organized in modules aimed at 2-3 weeks; modules 1-4 together should be roughly one semester of a two-semester, full-year course.


Each module comprises:

- introduction of grammatical topics
- minimally modified passages from the target corpus
- interactive exercises and drills
- ancient Greek in action: relating topics in this module to our lives today



## Additional notes for teachers


### Sequence of grammtical topics

Topics sequenced by: 

- prominence in target corpus
- unfamiliarity to English speakers
- complexity of the topic 
- priority to topics enabling students to explore continuous, contextualized reading, rather than isolated sentences

> -> **teach to the synopsis, not the paradigm**

### Vocabulary

First half of course: emphasis on a small core vocabulary (perhaps < 200 words).  This vocabulary is defined by comparison with other Greek corpora, and finding shared items in the highest frequency lists of individual corpora (rather than the common practice of finding most frequent terms in a *composite* list:  this effaces the differences in vocabulary from one corpus to another).

It includes:

- function words (prepositions, particles, conjunctions)
- the article and pronouns
- a small core of extremely common verbs, especially those which have a large number of compounds.  In counting the frequency of a simplex verb like φέρω, we include occurrences of compounds such as ἐπιφέρω or ἐκφέρω.

It includes a relatively small number of nouns, and fewer adjectives:  these parts of speech vary more from one corpus to another.


In the second half of the course, we focus on a second vocabulary tier:  terms that are frequent in the target corpus and related or similar texts, but not necessarily in other Greek corpora.  The goal is to have a large enough vocabulary to recognize 75-90% of the lexical items in the target text, excluding proper nouns and adjectives.  For some target texts, a vocabulary of < 500 words may be adequate.  This second vocabulary tier will include more verbs, a larger number of nouns, and some additional adjectives.
