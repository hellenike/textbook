### Module 3 composition

**Overview** You will compose a paragraph with seven sentences, modelled loosely on the narrative of Lysias 1.22-1.23.  Each sentence should have only one finite verb in Greek.  You can use appropriate participial expressions to express subordinate verbal ideas.  In addition to following the specific instructions for each sentence, you should consider the construction of your paragraph as a whole. Each sentence should be connected to the previous sentence with a particle;  you may choose to use nouns or pronouns depending on the context you have created in preceding parts of the paragraph.

You should use each vocabulary item in the list below at least once.

**Specific instructions**

1. Your first sentence should express that Euphiletos narrated the things that were done on that day. To express the idea of a specific moment in time, Greek uses the dative case (without any preposition), so you can simply put the phrase "that day" in the dative.
1. Your second sentence should say that Sostratos was a friend of Euphiletos.
1. In your third sentence, you should say that as the sun was setting, Euphiletos ran into Sostratos while Sostratos was coming back from the field.
1. The fourth sentence should say that Euphiletos urged Sostratos to dine with him since Sostratos' friends were not at home.  To express the idea "urged him to dine", use an appropriate form of the verb κελεύω together with a direct object, and συνδειπνεῖν (an infinitive, "to dine": we'll learn more about this kind of construction in a subsequent part of the course).
1. The fifth sentence should say that they went to Euphiletos house, went upstairs, and began to dine.
1. Next, you should say that after Sostratos had left, Euphiletos went to bed.
1. The final sentence should say that when the man from the market place came in to the house, the servant girl who had been seen by him happened to be watching the door.
