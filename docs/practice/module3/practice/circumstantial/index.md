### The circumstantial participle


Use a participle to compose a verbal unit express the **highlighted clause** in each of these sentences from Carolyn Falkner's translation of Lysias 1.  Supplement your vocabulary with the following: 

- μεθύω, μεθύσω, ἐμέθυσα, μεμέθυκα, μεμέθυμαι, ἐμεθύσθην, "to drink heavily, be drunk"
- ὀργίζω, "anger"; middle voice, "grow angry."



1. **When my mother died**, her passing proved to be the cause of all my problems.
1. I have a modest, two storey house, **which has equal space on the upper and lower floors**.
1. You made a grab at her before **when you were drunk**.
1. I noticed though, gentlemen, that her face was made up, **although her brother had died** not thirty days earlier.
1. **After some time had passed** during which I remained quite ignorant of the terrible way I was being treated, an old woman came up to me.
1. **The woman was angry**, and **thought** herself badly treated because he no longer visited her as he had, and so she waited until she found out the cause.
