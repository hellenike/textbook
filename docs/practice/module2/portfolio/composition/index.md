### Module 2 composition

**Overview**
You will compose a paragraph containing eight clauses. Using the instructions for each clause below, you should compose an appropriate verb, put nouns and pronouns in the correct case, and decide on a word order for each individual clause. You will also have to use a particle or conjunction to coordinate each clause with the rest of the paragraph. Your composition will express:

> For a long time Euphiletos did not suspect his wife. He came from the field to his house and was eating dinner upstairs. The baby was crying downstairs, and therefore Euphiletos’s wife left and closed the doors. That man was in the house, but Euphiletos did not see him.

**Specific instructions**
The first clause should express that Euphiletos did not feel suspicious toward his life for a long time when they were first married.  To express “for a long time,” use the accusative of χρόνος, χρόνου, ὁ and the masculine accusative adjective πολύν. For the verb use ὑποπτεύω, which is a compound verb, ὑπ[ό] + ὀπτεύω. The forms of ὑποπτεύω are completely regular (compare κελεύω). “His wife” is the direct object of the verb.

The next clauses start to express when things began to change. The second clause should express that he came home from working in the fields, and the third clause should express his eating his meal upstairs. Think about how to connect these two clauses. For the phrase “was eating dinner” use the epsilon-contract verb δειπνέω. “Upstairs” is the adverb ἄνω. 

The next two clauses should show the connection between the baby crying and the wife leaving the room (to go care for the baby). For the verb to cry, use the alpha-contract verb βοάω. “Downstairs” is the adverb κάτω. The verb “to leave” is λείπω, whose third principal part is ἔλιπον. The form (3rd person singular aorist active indicative) for “closed” is προσέθηκε. If it is the last word in its clause in your composition, add a nu-moveable, προσέθηκεν.

The final two clauses introduce a new subject—consider how you will indicate that. These two clauses should express that the unnamed (for now) adulterer was secretly inside the house on this particular evening. For “That man” you can use a demonstrative pronoun or a demonstrative adjective with a noun for “man.” For “him” in the final clause, use the accusative pronoun αὐτόν.
