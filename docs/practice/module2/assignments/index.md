## Reading from Lysias 1.9-1.12 (simplified)


> Each verbal unit is placed on a separate line. The verbal expression
> and any connecting words are **highlighted like this**.


τὸ τοῦ Εὐφιλήτου οἰκίδιον διπλοῦν **ἦν**, 

**καὶ** ἴσα τὰ ἄνω τοῖς κάτω κατὰ τὴν γυναικωνῖτιν καὶ κατὰ τὴν ἀνδρωνῖτιν **εἶχεν**. 


ἐπειδὴ **δὲ** τὸ παιδίον **ἐγένετο** αὐτοῖς, 

ἡ μήτηρ αὐτὸ **ἐθήλαζεν**. 


ἐν **οὖν** ἐκείνῳ τῷ χρόνῳ, ὁ Εὐφίλητος **μὲν** ἄνω **διῄτωτο**, 

αἱ **δὲ** γυναῖκες κάτω. 


**καὶ** ταῦτα πολὺν χρόνον οὕτως **ἐγίγνετο**, 

**καὶ** ὁ Εὐφίλητος οὐδέποτε **ὑπώπτευσεν**, 

**ἀλλ᾽** οὕτως ἠλιθίως **διέκειτο**.  


ἐν δὲ τῇ ἡμέρᾷ τῇδε, **ἧκε** **μὲν** ἀπροσδοκήτως ἐξ ἀγροῦ, 

μετὰ **δὲ** τὸ δεῖπνον τὸ παιδίον **ἐβόα** 

**καὶ** **ἐδυσκόλαινεν**, 

   **ὃ** ὑπὸ τῆς θεραπαίνης ἐπίτηδες **ἐλύπειτο**. 
  
  
ὁ **γὰρ** ἄνθρωπος ἔνδον **ἦν**. 


ὕστερον **γὰρ** ὁ Εὐφίλητος ἅπαντα **ἐπύθετο**.

### Questions

1. Fully identify each of the following verbs (that is, identify their person, number, tense, mood and voice), and give their first principal part.
    - εἶχεν
    - ἐγένετο
    - ἐγίγνετο
    - ἐλύπειτο
    
2. Identify the relative clause in the passage. What is the form (gender, case, and number) of the relative pronoun used? What is its antecedent, the noun it refers back to? Recall that it must be the same gender and number as the relative pronoun. 



#### Glosses and notes

- 
- 
- 
- Εὐφιλήτῳ "to Euphiletos". 
- γῆμαι "to marry" (an infinitive form of the verb [γαμέω](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n21556))
- γυναῖκα, "woman, wife".   In the Liddell-Scott Greek lexicon, read [definition B.1.2 for the verb ἄγω](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n27847). (You'll need to scroll a ways to find it!)  This definition specifically refers to using the noun γυναῖκα as the direct object of ἄγω.  
- εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν "to his house".  Notice that in definition B.1.2 of ἄγω linked above, the second example (from the historian Herodotus, abbreviated "Hdt.") has the phrase γυναῖκα ἄ. ἐς τὰ οἰκία, an exactly equivalent phrase to Lysias' γυναῖκα ἄ. εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν.
- παιδίον "a child" (subject of the verb)
- αὐτῷ "to him" (refers to Euphiletos)
- ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ χρόνῳ "at first" The whole phrase goes together:   the particles μὲν οὖν start a new clause, and the phrase "at first" is the first piece of that clause.
 - **ἦν** Understand Euphiletos' wife as the subject: "She was..."
- πασῶν βελτίστη "the best of all women".
- **μὲν οὖν ... ἀλλὰ** μέν starts a new topic; οὖν adds an additional nuance of empahsis to this clause -- "really, in fact".  Here, μέν is not continued by δέ; instead, the conjuncation ἀλλά introduces a strong contrasting clause (here in fact, two clauses joined by καί: their verbs are ἐτελεύτησε and ἐγένετο).
- ἡ Εὐφιλήτου μήτηρ "Euphiletos' mother" (subject of the verb ἐτελεύτησε; assume it continues as subject of the following verb ἐγένετο as well).
- πάντων τῶν κακῶν αἰτία "the cause of all his troubles".
