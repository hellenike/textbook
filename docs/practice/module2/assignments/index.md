## Reading from Lysias 1.9-1.12 (simplified)


> Each verbal unit is placed on a separate line. The verbal expression
> and any connecting words are **highlighted like this**.


τὸ τοῦ Εὐφιλήτου οἰκίδιον διπλοῦν **ἦν**, 

**καὶ** ἴσα τὰ ἄνω τοῖς κάτω κατὰ τὴν γυναικωνῖτιν καὶ κατὰ τὴν ἀνδρωνῖτιν **εἶχεν**. 


ἐπειδὴ **δὲ** τὸ παιδίον **ἐγένετο** αὐτοῖς, 

ἡ μήτηρ αὐτὸ **ἐθήλαζεν**. 


ἐν **οὖν** ἐκείνῳ τῷ χρόνῳ, ὁ Εὐφίλητος **μὲν** ἄνω **διῄτωτο**, 

αἱ **δὲ** γυναῖκες κάτω. 


**καὶ** ταῦτα πολὺν χρόνον οὕτως **ἐγίγνετο**, 

**καὶ** ὁ Εὐφίλητος οὐδέποτε **ὑπώπτευσεν**, 

**ἀλλ᾽** οὕτως ἠλιθίως **διέκειτο**.  


ἐν δὲ τῇ ἡμέρᾷ τῇδε, **ἧκε** **μὲν** ἀπροσδοκήτως ἐξ ἀγροῦ, 

μετὰ **δὲ** τὸ δεῖπνον τὸ παιδίον **ἐβόα** 

**καὶ** **ἐδυσκόλαινεν**, 

   **ὃ** ὑπὸ τῆς θεραπαίνης ἐπίτηδες **ἐλύπειτο**. 
  
  
ὁ **γὰρ** ἄνθρωπος ἔνδον **ἦν**. 


ὕστερον **γὰρ** ὁ Εὐφίλητος ἅπαντα **ἐπύθετο**.

### Questions

1. Fully identify each of the following verbs (that is, identify their person, number, tense, mood and voice), and give their first principal part.
    - εἶχεν
    - ἐγένετο
    - ἐγίγνετο
    - ἐλύπειτο
    
2. Identify the relative clause in the passage. What is the form (gender, case, and number) of the relative pronoun used? What is its antecedent, the noun it refers back to? Recall that it must be the same gender and number as the relative pronoun. 



#### Glosses and notes

- οἰκίδιον is a diminutive form of the noun οἰκία, which is used elsewhere in the speech. So it means "little house" or "small house" instead of just "house." Why do you think Euphiletos might use this diminutive form when describing his house to the jury?
- διπλοῦν, a neuter nominative adjective; the ending is contracted from διπλο- + -ον. It menas "double" or "twofold" so in this context something like "two floors"
- **ἦν** third singular imperfect indicative active from εἰμί "to be"

- ἴσα from the adjective ἴσος, ἴση, ἴσον "equal." Can you think of any English words derived from this Greek adjective?
- ἄνω and κάτω are adverbs. ἄνω means "up" or "above" and κάτω means "down" or "below." Both are used here with forms of the article. Reread the section on substantive adjectives: the article is operating in a similar manner with these adverbs.
- κατὰ τὴν γυναικωνῖτιν καὶ κατὰ τὴν ἀνδρωνῖτιν: prepositions in ancient Greek are used idiomatically, as they are in English. Use the form of the article to discern the gender, case, and number of the nouns γυναικωνῖτιν and ἀνδρωνῖτιν. Look back at the section on prepositions to see teh range of meaning κατά has with that case, and then think about how to make that idiomatic English to express the same idea.
- γυναικωνῖτιν and ἀνδρωνῖτιν: notice that the beginnings of these words come from the nouns γυνή, γυναικός, ἡ and ἀνήρ, ἀνδρός, ὁ. They means something like "women's rooms" or "women's space" and "men's rooms" or "men's space." These are cultural concepts that we have to learn to correctly understand what is being described. 


- Εὐφιλήτῳ "to Euphiletos". 
- γῆμαι "to marry" (an infinitive form of the verb [γαμέω](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n21556))
- γυναῖκα, "woman, wife".   In the Liddell-Scott Greek lexicon, read [definition B.1.2 for the verb ἄγω](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n27847). (You'll need to scroll a ways to find it!)  This definition specifically refers to using the noun γυναῖκα as the direct object of ἄγω.  
- εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν "to his house".  Notice that in definition B.1.2 of ἄγω linked above, the second example (from the historian Herodotus, abbreviated "Hdt.") has the phrase γυναῖκα ἄ. ἐς τὰ οἰκία, an exactly equivalent phrase to Lysias' γυναῖκα ἄ. εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν.
- παιδίον "a child" (subject of the verb)
- αὐτῷ "to him" (refers to Euphiletos)
- ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ χρόνῳ "at first" The whole phrase goes together:   the particles μὲν οὖν start a new clause, and the phrase "at first" is the first piece of that clause.
 - **ἦν** Understand Euphiletos' wife as the subject: "She was..."
- πασῶν βελτίστη "the best of all women".
- **μὲν οὖν ... ἀλλὰ** μέν starts a new topic; οὖν adds an additional nuance of empahsis to this clause -- "really, in fact".  Here, μέν is not continued by δέ; instead, the conjuncation ἀλλά introduces a strong contrasting clause (here in fact, two clauses joined by καί: their verbs are ἐτελεύτησε and ἐγένετο).
- ἡ Εὐφιλήτου μήτηρ "Euphiletos' mother" (subject of the verb ἐτελεύτησε; assume it continues as subject of the following verb ἐγένετο as well).
- πάντων τῶν κακῶν αἰτία "the cause of all his troubles".
