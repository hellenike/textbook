### Noun phrases with the nominative and genitive


Using the vocabulary list for module 2, compose two Greek expressions for each English noun phrase. Assume that the noun phrase functions as the subject of a sentence, and compose two Greek versions using different forms of the attributive position.

1. The death of the citizen
1. The personâ€™s (a man) vengeance
1. The servant/slave/attendant of the person (a woman)
1. The fields of the people
1. The death of the slave
