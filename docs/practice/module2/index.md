### Persistent Accent Practice

Study and practice the following basic patterns of persistent accents on nouns.

1. Persistent accent on the antepenult. Only acute accents live on antepenult, and it will be on the antepenult whenever the ultima is short (a requirement for the antepenult to be accented). When the ultima is long, the accent shifts to the penult, and will be acute.

Examples: ἄνθρωπος, ἀνθρώπου, ὁ / ἡ  "human being, person"  (second declension); 
|   | Case | Form |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Singular |   |    |   | 
|   | Nominative | ἄνθρωπος  | 
|   | Genitive | ἀνθρώπου  |
|   | Dative  | ἀνθρώπῳ |
|   | Accusative | ἄνθρωπον |
|   | Vocative | ἄνθρωπε |
| Plural |    |    |
|   | Nominative | ἄνθρωποι |
|   | Genitive | ἀνθρώπων |
|   | Dative  | ἀνθρώποις  |
|   | Accusative | ἀνθρώπους  |
|   | Vocative | ἄνθρωποι   |

2. Persistent accent on a long penult. Accent will remain on penult (with exception of genitive plural in first declension). If ultima is short, accent will be circumflex; if ultima is long, accent will be acute. Examples: γνώμη, γνώμης, ἡ "judgment, opinion" (first declension) and δῶρον, δώρου, τό "gift" (second declension)
 
|   | Case | Form |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Singular |    |  |
|   | Nominative | γνώμη  | δῶρον |
|   | Genitive | γνώμης  | δώρου   |
|   | Dative  | γνώμῃ  | δώρῳ  |
|   | Accusative | γνώμην  | δῶρον |
|   | Vocative | γνώμη | δῶρον |
| Plural |    |    |
|   | Nominative | γνῶμαι | δῶρα |
|   | Genitive | γνωμῶν  | δώρων |
|   | Dative  | γνώμαις  | δώροις |
|   | Accusative | γνώμας  | δῶρα |
|   | Vocative | γνῶμαι  | δῶρα |

3. Persistent accent on a short penult. The accent will remain on the penult and will remain acute (with exception of genitive plural in first declension). (Recall that circumflex accents are carried only by long vowels and diphthongs.) Examples: οἰκία, οἰκίας, ἡ "house" (first declension); χρόνος, χρόνου, ὁ "time, time period" (second declension); and ἔργον, ἔργου, τό "work, deed" (second declension).

|   | Case | Form | |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
| Singular |   |    |  |  |
|   | Nominative | οἰκία | χρόνος | ἔργον |
|   | Genitive | οἰκίας   | χρόνου | ἔργου |
|   | Dative  | οἰκίᾳ  | χρόνῳ | ἔργῳ |
|   | Accusative | οἰκίαν  | χρόνον | ἔργον
|   | Vocative | οἰκία   | χρόνε | ἔργον
| Plural |    |    |  |  |
|   | Nominative | οἰκίαι   | χρόνοι | ἔργα |
|   | Genitive | οἰκιῶν  | χρόνων | ἔργων |
|   | Dative  | οἰκίαις   | χρόνοις | ἔργοις |
|   | Accusative | οἰκίας  | χρόνους | ἔργα |
|   | Vocative | οἰκίαι   | χρόνοι | ἔργα |

4. Persistent accent on the ultima. 
|   | Case | Form |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Singular |   |    |
|   | Nominative |   |
|   | Genitive |  |
|   | Dative  |   |
|   | Accusative |   |
|   | Vocative |   |
| Plural |    |    |
|   | Nominative |   |
|   | Genitive |  |
|   | Dative  |   |
|   | Accusative |   |
|   | Vocative |   |


Identify the pattern to which each of the following nouns belongs to, and practice the accent pattern in the full declension of the noun:

παιδίον, παιδίου, τό 
ἡμέρα, ἡμέρας, ἡ 
λόγος, λόγου, ὁ
