## Nouns and adjectives: practice


### Persistent Accent Practice

Study and practice the following basic patterns of persistent accents on nouns.

1. Persistent accent on the antepenult. Only acute accents live on antepenult, and it will be on the antepenult whenever the ultima is short (a requirement for the antepenult to be accented). When the ultima is long, the accent shifts to the penult, and will be acute.

Example: ἄνθρωπος, ἀνθρώπου, ὁ human being, person (second declension)
