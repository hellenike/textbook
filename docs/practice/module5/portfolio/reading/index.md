### Module 5 reading 

The following is a modified version of Lysias 1.19–20. 

Euphiletos has taken the enslaved woman away from the house and is confronting her with what he has been told about Eratosthenes and his wide.

ἡ θεράπαινα τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ἔξαρνος ἦν, καὶ Εὐφίλητον ποιεῖν ἐκέλευεν ὅ τι βούλεται: οὐδὲν γὰρ εἰδέναι. ἐπειδὴ δὲ Εὐφίλητος ἔφη τὸ ὄνομα Ἐρατοσθένους πρὸς αὐτήν, καὶ εἶπεν ὅτι οὗτος ὁ φοιτῶν εἴη πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα, ἐκείνη ἐξεπλάγη ἡγησαμένη αὐτὸν πάντα ἀκριβῶς εἰδέναι. καὶ τότε κατηγόρει πρῶτον μὲν ὡς μετὰ τὴν ἐκφορὰν αὐτῇ προσίοι, ἔπειτα ὡς αὐτὴ τελευτῶσα εἰσαγγείλειε καὶ ὡς ἐκείνη τῷ χρόνῳ πεισθείη, καὶ τἆλλα τὰ γενόμενα πάντα ἀκριβῶς διηγήσατο.

#### For this paragraph:
1. Identify the boundaries of each clause. 
2. Identify which clauses represent indirect speech, and which structure of indirect speech is being used.
3. Compose an idiomatic translation in English of the entire passage using the notes and glosses below.

#### Notes and glosses
πρῶτον = “first”; τὸ πρῶτον = “at first”

βούλεται, 3rd singular present middle indicative from βούλομαι 

οὐδὲν, neuter singular accusative, “nothing”

εἰδέναι, infinitive with present sense from irregular verb οἶδα, “know”

Ἐρατοσθένους, note the case here: Ἐρατοσθένης declines like the m/f singular of the adjective ἀληθής, ἀληθές 

φοιτῶν < φοιτάω “go/come frequently, visit frequently”

ἐξεπλάγη 3rd singular aorist passive indicative from ἐκπλήσσω “astound, astonish”

ἀκριβῶς adverb, “precisely, exactly, accurately”

κατηγόρει 3rd singular imperfect active indicative from the compound verb κατηγορέω, a legal term used metaphorically here, “accuse, allege, bring charges”

ἐκφορὰν < ἐκφορά, ἐκφορᾶς, ἡ “funeral procession”

προσίοι < προσεῖμι, compound of προς + εἶμι 

αὐτὴ note that the nominative is intensive referring to the subject “she herself,” distinguishing the enslaved woman whose speech is being reported from the wife

τελευτῶσα < τελευτάω “accomplish, finish, bring to pass”—the participle is used to mean something adverbial like “at last, in the end”

εἰσαγγείλειε < compound verb εἰς + ἀγγέλλω, whose 3rd principal part is εἰσήγγειλα, “bring messages to” 

πεισθείη < πείθω, πείσω, ἔπεισα, πέποιθα, πέπεισμαι, ἐπείσθην “persuade” 

τἆλλα = τὰ ἄλλα instead of eliding the alpha before the next alpha, the two words are combined by crasis

διηγήσατο < compound διὰ + ἡγέομαι “recount in detail, describe in detail”
