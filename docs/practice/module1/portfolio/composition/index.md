### Module 1 composition
 

#### Overview 

You will compose a paragraph containing five clauses.  Using the instructions for each clause below, you should compose an appropriate verb, and decide on a word order for the individual clause; you will then have to use a particle or conjunction to coordinate each clause with the rest of the paragraph.  The summary of your composition will express:

> Euphiletos considered his wife the best of all women.  Everything was managed wonderfully. But then Euphiletos' mother died.  His wife was taking part in the funeral procession, and was seen by Eratosthenes. 

#### Specific instructions


The first clause should express that Euphiletos considered his wife the best possible wife. For the subject of the verb, use  Ἐυφίλητος.  To express what he considered, use the phrase τὴν γυναῖκα πασῶν βελτίστην.

The second clause should express that everything was managed wonderfully.  Use πάντα for the subject "everything", and κάλλιστα to express "wonderfully."  Think about the logical connection between the first two clauses.


Next, express "But then, his mother died."  Use ἡ μήτηρ as the subject.

The next two clauses should say that Euphiletos’ wife was taking part in the funeral procession for his mother, and she was seen by Eratosthenes.  For Euphiletos’ wife, use ἡ γυνή.  To express "taking part in the funeral procession", you can use the Greek idiom "she followed the procession". Use the regular epsilon contract verb ἀκολουθέω ("to follow") with the phrase ἐπʼ ἐκφορὰν to convey this.  To exress "by Eratosthenes, use ὑπὸ Ἐρατοσθένους.
