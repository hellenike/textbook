### Vocalizing Greek


Practice reading these out loud the names of these people and places:

- Ἐρατοσθένης  (name of the murdered man in Lysias, *Oration 1*)
- Εὐφίλητος (name of the man accused of murder)
- Σώστρατος (name of a friend of Εὐφίλητος)
- ὦ ̓Αθηναῖοι ("O, Athenians," frequently used to address the jury, composed of Athenian citizens) 
- Ὀῆθεν ("from Oê," a *deme* or district of Athens; citizens were registered by deme, so the deme name was often used in identifying  citizens)
- Σώστρατος  (a friend of Euphiletos)
- Ἁρμόδιος (a friend of Euphiletos)
- Ἀρείου πάγος (The Hill of Ares in Athens, where courts met in homicide cases)

Practice reading aloud these Greek words:

- ἄνθρωποι (compare English "anthropology")
- χρόνος (compare English "chronology")
- θεράπαινα (compare English "therapy")
- τέχνη (compare English "technology")
- ἀγορά (compare English "agoraphobic")
- ψεῦδος (compare the English prefix "pseudo-")
- ἱερόν (compare English "hierarchy")
- φίλος (compare the English prefix "phil-" or "philo-")
- πραγματικός (compare English "pragmatic")
- δύναμαι (compare English "dynamic")
- γυναιξὶ (compare English "gynecology")
- ποιητής (compare English "poet")
- σκέψασθε (compare English "sceptic")
- μάρτυρες (compare English "martyr")


### Pronunciation with accent

As you'll learn in module 2, Greek nouns change their endings to indicate their function. Each pair of nouns below shows two forms of the same noun: pronounce them so that you can hear clearly which syllable is stressed in each instance.

- name of the man accused of murder in Lysias 1: Εὐφίλητος,  Εὐφιλήτου
- Athenians: Ἀθηναῖοι, Ἀθηναίους
- citizen of a city-state (compare English "political"): πολίτης, πολιτῶν 
- witnesses: μάρτυρες, μαρτύρων
