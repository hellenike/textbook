### Vocalizing Greek


Practice reading these words out loud:

- Ἐρατοσθένης  (name of the murdered man in Lysias, *Oration 1*)
- Εὐφίλητος (name of the man accused of murder)
- Σώστρατος (name of a friend of Εὐφίλητος)
- Ἀθηναῖοι 



### Pronunciation practice

Practice pronouncing the following words. As you'll learn in Module 2, Greek nouns change their endings to indicate their function. Each pair of words shows two forms of the same noun: pronounce them so that you can hear clearly which syllable is stressed in each instance.

- Εὐφίλητος (name of the man accused of murder in Lysias 1)
- Εὐφιλήτου
- Ἀθηναῖοι (Athenians)
- Ἀθηναίους
- πολίτης (the word for citizen of a city-state, compare English "political")
- πολιτῶν
