### The second aorist




#### Practice

Recall that the first, third and sixth principal parts of the verb "throw, hit (by throwing), strike (by throwing)" are βάλλω, ἔβαλον and ἐβλήθην.

Compose the correct Greek form for the highlighted verb in the following English phrases, and fully identify the form (person, number, tense, mood, voice).

1. She *used to throw* the dice.
2. He *hit* Pandorus with a spear.
3. He *was struck* by the weapon.
4. They "*were throwing (for themselves)* their cloaks around their shoulders".  (a Greek idiom for putting on a garment)
