## Reading from Lysias 1.7-1.8 (simplified)


> Each verbal unit is placed on a separate line. The verbal expression
> and any connecting words are **highlighted like this**.
> Words and phrases *highlighted like this* are glossed below.



**ἔδοξε** *Εὐφιλήτῳ* *γῆμαι* 

**καὶ** *γυναῖκα* **ἠγάγετο** *εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν*.


*παιδίον* **δέ** **ἐγένετο** *αὐτῷ*,

**καὶ** **ἐπίστευε** *ἤδη*

**καὶ** *πάντα* *ἐκείνῃ* **παρέδωκε**.

*ἐν* **μὲν οὖν** *τῷ πρώτῳ χρόνῳ*, *πασῶν* **ἦν** *βελτίστη*.

**ἀλλὰ** *ἡ Εὐφιλήτου μήτηρ*  **ἐτελεύτησε**

**καὶ** *πάντων τῶν κακῶν αἰτία* **ἐγένετο**.


### Questions

1. Fully identify each of the following verbs (that is, identify their person, number, tense, mood and voice), and give their first principal part.
    - ἔδοξε
    - ἠγάγετο
    - ἐγένετο
    - ἐτελεύτησε
2. Notice that ἐπίστευε and παρέδωκε are coordinated with καί, but are in different tenses.  Why do you think Lysias chooses the specific tenses he uses here?  The little adverb [ἤδη](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n46646) gives us a clue: it can mean that its clause only happened *after* the previously narrated events.


### Glosses and notes

- *Εὐφιλήτῳ* "to Euphiletus". 
- *γῆμαι* "to marry" (an infinitive form of the verb [γαμέω](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n21556)
- *γυναῖκα*, "woman, wife".   In the Liddell-Scott Greek lexicon, read [definition B.1.2 for the verb ἄγω](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n27847). (You'll need to scroll a ways to find it!)  This definition specifically refers to using the noun γυναῖκα as the direct object of ἄγω.  
- *εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν* "to his house".  Notice that in definition B.1.2 of ἄγω linked above, the second examples (from the historian Herodotus, abbreviated "Hdt.") has the phrase γυναῖκα ἄ. ἐς τὰ οἰκία, an exactly equivalent phrase to Lysias' γυναῖκα ἄ. εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν.
- *παιδίον* "a child" (subject of the verb)
- *αὐτῷ* "to him" (refers to Euphiletus)
*ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ χρόνῳ* "at first" The whole phrase goes together:   the particles μὲν οὖν start a new clause, and the phrase "at first" is the first piece of that clause.
 - **ἦν** Understand Euphiletus' wife as the subject: "She was..."
- *πασῶν βελτίστη* "the best of all women".
- **μὲν οὖν**.  μέν starts a new list; οὖν additionally informs that the list follows as a consequence of the previous clause: "So..."
