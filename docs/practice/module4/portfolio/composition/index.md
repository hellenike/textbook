### Module 4 Composition assignment

Compose a paragraph of five connected sentences that conveys the narrative of Euphiletos hearing about his wife’s affair, asking the enslaved woman about it, and the enslaved woman’s confession about what had happened.

The first sentence should convey that Euphiletos heard that Eratosthenes was frequently coming and going to visit his wife. Use the indirect speech construction of ἀκούω + accusative + participle. Use the verb φοιτάω to mean “frequently coming and going” and πρὸς  + accusative for “to visit his wife.”

The second sentence should convey that Euphiletos therefore asked the enslaved woman what was happening in the house. Use ἐρωτάω, ἐρωτήσω, ἠρώτησα, ἠρώτηκα, —, ἠρωτήθην ask plus an indirect question that uses an optative of γίγνομαι for “was happening.”

The third sentence should say that the enslaved woman at first denied everything. Use τό πρῶτον for “at first” and οὐ + φημί in the imperfect to mean “denied.”

The fourth sentence should convey that when Euphiletos asked again (αὖθις), the enslaved woman said that Eratosthenes persuaded her to bring messages to the wife. Use πείθω, πείσω, ἔπεισα, πέποιθα, πέπεισμαι, ἐπείσθην for “persuade” and εἰσαγγέλλω, 3rd principal part εἰσήγγειλα for “to bring messages,” which is a complementary infinitive.

The fifth sentence should convey that after Euphiletos heard the truth (“the true things”), he told the enslaved woman not to say anything to anyone concerning the matter.
