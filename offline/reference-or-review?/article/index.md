Some points to note:

- There is no vocative form of the article.
- Note that the alpha in the neuter nominative and accusative plural form, τά, is a short alpha, while the alpha in the feminine accusative plural form, τάς, is a long alpha.  
-  The accent pattern of the article is that of a persistent accent on the ultima: acite in nominative and accusative cases — with the important exception here of the *proclitic* (unaccented) forms in the masculine/feminine nominative forms ὁ, ἡ, οἱ, αἱ — and circumflex on the genitive and dative forms.
