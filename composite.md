# About this textbook

## Content

  - targetted to a specific text or corpus
  - covers only features of language found in the target texts

## Organization

Organized in modules aimed at 2-3 weeks; modules 1-4 together should be roughly one semester of a two-semester, full-year course.

Each module comprises:

  - introduction of grammatical topics
  - minimally modified passages from the target corpus
  - interactive exercises and drills
  - ancient Greek in action: relating topics in this module to our lives today

## Additional notes for teachers

### Sequence of grammtical topics

Topics sequenced by:

  - prominence in target corpus
  - unfamiliarity to English speakers
  - complexity of the topic
  - priority to topics enabling students to explore continuous, contextualized reading, rather than isolated sentences

> -> **teach to the synopsis, not the paradigm**

### Vocabulary

First half of course: emphasis on a small core vocabulary (perhaps < 200 words).  This vocabulary is defined by comparison with other Greek corpora, and finding shared items in the highest frequency lists of individual corpora (rather than the common practice of finding most frequent terms in a *composite* list:  this effaces the differences in vocabulary from one corpus to another).

It includes:

  - function words (prepositions, particles, conjunctions)
  - the article and pronouns
  - a small core of extremely common verbs, especially those which have a large number of compounds.  In counting the frequency of a simplex verb like φέρω, we include occurrences of compounds such as ἐπιφέρω or ἐκφέρω.

It includes a relatively small number of nouns, and fewer adjectives:  these parts of speech vary more from one corpus to another.

In the second half of the course, we focus on a second vocabulary tier:  terms that are frequent in the target corpus and related or similar texts, but not necessarily in other Greek corpora.  The goal is to have a large enough vocabulary to recognize 75-90% of the lexical items in the target text, excluding proper nouns and adjectives.  For some target texts, a vocabulary of < 500 words may be adequate.  This second vocabulary tier will include more verbs, a larger number of nouns, and some additional adjectives.




# The Greek alphabet

## Overview

Notes for overview:

  - the form of the Greek alphabet we use evolved over many centuries
  - memorize the alphabet in alphabetical order so you can use a dictionary
  - practice reading aloud until you are comfortable pronouncing Greek words you have not seen before

Ω  ω 	|  omega |   b**o**ne			           |     ὥρα (“season, hour”)

## Breathings

Another sound to add: words beginning with a vowel will have what is called a breathing mark written over that vowel. There are two kinds of breathing marks:
smooth breathing looks like this ’ and adds no sound to the vowel
rough breathing looks like this ‘ and adds an ‘h’ sound to the vowel (words beginning with a rho also have a rough breathing, making it an ‘rh’ sound)

## Diphthongs

Diphthongs are combinations of two vowels that result in one syllable. English has them, too. In Greek, diphthongs are combinations of iota or upsilon with other vowels.

diphthong |	pronunciation guide	|  model Greek word
--- | --- | ---
αι 	|	    **ai**sle		  |	      αἰδώς (“sense of shame, respect”)
αυ 	|	    h**ou**se, pl**ow**		|        αὔριον (“tomorrow”)
ει 	|	    w**ei**gh			    |        εἰρήνη (“peace”)
ευ 	|	    ε + υ 			  |        εὖ (“well,” the adverb of “good”)
οι 	|	    c**oi**n			    |        οἰκία (“house, home”)
ου 	|	    s**ou**p, b**oo**t		|        οὐρανός (“sky”)
υι 	|	    **wi**t			      |        υἱός (“son”)

Accents and breathing marks are written over the second vowel of a diphthong.

### Iota subscript

When iota combines with long alpha, eta, or omega, one modern convention is to write it beneath the vowel as an “iota subscript,” which look like this:   ᾳ, ῃ, ῳ
Some guides suggest pronouncing such combinations as a diphthong; in practice, I will not. But in writing the iota subscript is absolutely essential and cannot be ignored. [[Neel and Mary differ on pronunication]]

## A few further details

A few details to note:

  - "rough breathing" spells out when words spelled with an initial vowel start with an "h-" sound
  - sigma changes form at the end of a word but is not pronounced differently
  - "iota subscript" became an alternate way of spelling a final iota when the final iota began to be dropped in pronounciation. (You could think of it as similar to using an apostrophe when you write a contraction like "don't" in English, but we'll make a habit of pronouncing the iota subscript.)

Tips:

  - read out loud (as the ancient Greeks did!)
  - we can't precisely recover ancient pronounciation, but try to distinguish sounds that are spelled differently (e.g., ο/ω ε/η ), and include accent in your pronounciation.  Hear the difference between ἀστραπηβόλος, "one who throws lightning" (an adjective describing Zeus) and ἀστραπήβολος  "one struck by lightning". It makes a difference! English similarly distinguishes otherwise identical words based on (stress) accent. How does the way you pronounce the following English word change their meaning? content, present, object, insult, permit

Practice reading these words out loud:

  - Ἐρατοσθένης  (name of the murdered man in Lysias, *Oration 1*)
  - Εὐφίλητος (name of the man accused of murder)
  - Σώστρατος (name of a friend of Εὐφίλητος)
  - Ἀθηναῖοι




# Module 1: the Greek verb

## Language

Module 1 introduces these features of Greek:

  - recessive accent in verbs
  - how to recognize verb forms and identify them with person, number, tense, mood, voice
  - principal parts of Greek verbs
  - the aorist and imperfect indicative tenses

### Ancient Greek in action

Different languages imagine the world differently. To narrate past events, for example, English does not have a single verb tense that correspond to the ideas expressed by the Greek imperfect tense. Module 1 includes reflections of English speakers encountering a different imperfect tense in Spanish and Italian.

## Reading

In our reading in module 1, we meet Euphiletus, the speaker in Lysias, *Oration 1*.  Euphiletus describes the early days of his marriage (to a wife who is never named).




## The Greek verb




## Ancient Greek accents

### General rules:

There are three types of accents: (1) acute ´   (2) grave    (3) circumflex ˜

Accents are written over vowels. If a diphthong is accented, the accent is written over the second vowel of the diphthong (e.g., εὖ). In classical Greece the accent was a pitch accent: that is, the pitch of your voice would rise or lower. Because English speakers are accustomed to stress accents, we will stress any accented syllable, regardless of type of accent, when pronouncing a word.

Accents appear on only the last three syllables of a word, and almost every word will have an accent of some kind. These syllables are called
the antepenult (third from last)
the penult (next to last)
the ultima (last)

Some small words do not carry an accent: those that do not carry an accent or affect the accents of other words are called proclitics and are short words such as some forms of the article (ὁ, ἡ, οἱ, αἱ) and prepositions like εἰς, ἐκ, ἐν. There are also enclitics, short words that affect the accents of other words in a sentence but do not have their own accent.

Placement and type of accent depend on the length of vowels in the word.
Short vowels = α, ε, ι, ο, υ
Long vowels = α, η, ι, ω, υ. Diphthongs are long, expect for final –αι, -οι in some forms.

An acute accent can appear on any of these syllables. It is the only accent that lives on the antepenult and can live there only if the ultima is short. Therefore, if the ultima has a long vowel or diphthong, the antepenult will not be accented.

A grave accent appears only on the ultima and only in a sentence: a grave accent replaces what would have been an acute accent on the ultima of a word followed directly (i.e., no punctuation intervenes) by another accented word in a sentence. This means that in a paradigm of noun, adjective, or verb forms you will not see or use a grave accent. It also means that the last word of a sentence does not have the change from acute to grave since no word follows without punctuation intervening.

A circumflex accent appears only on the penult or the ultima—never on the antepenult. It accents long vowels or diphthongs only. It will appear on the penult under the following circumstances: the penult is accented, the vowel or diphthong of the syllable is long, and the ultima is short—all of the conditions must be true and when they are true the accent must be a circumflex.

### Recessive accent

The accent on finite verb forms in ancient Greek is described as recessive, meaning the accent recedes as far back from the end of the word as the possible, in accordance with the set of rules governing accentuation.

The rules that apply to these forms:

 1. The accent cannot recede further back than the antepenult. Therefore, the accent will reside on one of the last three syllables of a finite verb form, even if it has more than three syllables.

 2. If the ultima is long, the accent recedes to the penult and is an acute accent on the penult.
 3. If the ultima is short:[reminder that final -αι and -οι are usually short]
    a. if there are three or more syllables in the form, the accent will recede to the antepenult and be an acute accent on that syllable.
    b. if there are two syllables, the accent will be on the penult. Since the ultima is short, when the penult is accented its form will depend on the quantity of the penult syllable: if it is short, the accent will be acute. If it is long, the accent will be a circumflex.

Other situations with circumflex accents on finite verb forms:
4. As we learn contracted verb forms, where two vowels have combined to one sound, we will see circumflex accents mark those contractions when possible under the rules for circumflex accents. [do we explain compound verb forms yet? a couple of examples already in Lysias I.6]

 5. If the verb form is only one syllable and it is long, it will carry a circumflex accent.

Practice for recessive accents:
On the following finite verb forms, determine the correct placement and type of accent in accordance with the rules of recessive accents, and then put it there. [Verb forms from Lysias I.6–11]

"Verb" is a part of speech. Its function is to express an action or a state of being. As Schoolhouse Rock put it decades ago, Verb: that's what happening.

## Finite Verb Forms

The verb forms we call "finite" are those that serve as the predicate in sentences or independent clauses. Nonfinite verb forms, which include verbal nouns such as infinitives and verbal adjectives such as participles, will be introduced in Module #.

Finite verb forms have five properties: **person**, **number**, **tense**, **voice**, and **mood**. To properly identify a finite verb form, you must identify all five properties. Ancient Greek finite verb forms contain all of this information in the verb form itself. In English, we often need other words to convey some of this information, such as subject pronouns to convey the person and number, and auxiliary (or "helping") verbs to express tense, mood, and voice.

### Person

A verb's person expresses the subject of the verb in relation to the "speaker" of the sentence.
The first person (I or we in English) subject includes the speaker.
The second person (you in English) subject is the addressee(s) of the speaker.
The third person (he, she, it, they in English) subject is a person or thing separate from the speaker and addressee.

### Number

Number combines with person in describing the subject of verb. It indicates when the subject is singular or plural. In English, for example, 1st person singular is "I" while 1st person plural is "we."

Ancient Greek also has an additional "number" known as the dual, when the subject is two persons, animals, body parts (e.g., eyes, hands), or things acting together.

Subject-verb agreement means the the person and number of the subject must be the same as the person and number of the verb. Note, however, that in Ancient Greek neuter plural nouns take a 3rd person singular verb form.

### Tense

The tense of a finite verb describes the time of the action and/or its aspect. "Aspect" refers to the type of the action as simple/single, ongoing/repeated, or completed.

Ancient Greek has seven tenses, which are divided into "primary" and "secondary" tenses. The "secondary" tenses are all past tenses, while the "primary" tenses represent actions in the present or future.

-Primary tenses: Present, Future, Perfect, Future Perfect
-Secondary tenses: Imperfect, Aorist, Pluperfect

Multiple tenses for action in a particular "time" (such as the past) differ in terms of *aspect*. Aspect emphasizes the type of action being represented, or how the action is being depicted. Aspects include **simple**, **ongoing or continuous** and **completed**. Tense can indicate both time and aspect, or, in some verb forms, aspect alone.

### Voice

Voice expresses the relationship between the action of the verb and the subject. English has two voices: active, in which the subject is performing the action of the verb ("I love"), and passive, in which the subject is receiving the action of the verb ("I am loved").

Ancient Greek has active and passive voices that operate the same way. It also has a third voice, the middle. In the middle voice, the subject performs the action of the verb with a particular interest or reference between the subject and the action of the verb, such as reflexive ("I love myself"), reciprocal ("we love each other"), initiating the action to be performed by another ("I got my hair cut") or with a particular self-interest ("I love for my own reasons, in my own interests").

In some uses (and for some verbs in all uses), the middle forms will have a meaning that is best represented by an active verb form in English. But paying attention the the ideas that the middle form represents is important for understanding ancient Greek modes of expression.

For some verb tenses, the middle and the passive share the same form. If you are identifying the form alone, you should identify it as "middle/passive." In a sentence, however, you will consider other syntactic structures within the clause or sentence to determine whether that particular use is middle or is passive, in order to understand the clause or sentence correctly.

### Mood

The mood of a verb indicates the function of the expression and the nature of the action in the speaker's conception. "Mood" and "mode" come from the same root in English: the "mood" of a verb is the "mode" in which the verb is operating.

Ancient Greek has four moods: (1) the indicative, used to express statement or question of a factual nature (in the eyes of the speaker) in the past, present, or future; (2) the imperative, used to give a command; (3) the subjective and (4) the optative, which have many uses in subordinate clauses and are also used to express potential or possible action or action that could have happened but did not.

## Negation with finite verb forms

There are two basic words in ancient Greek used to negate a finite verb form: οὐ and μή. ("not")
οὐ: Indicative verbs in most clauses are negated with οὐ. Note that οὐ has a smooth breathing and no accent. If the word that follows οὐ in a sentence begins with a vowel also with a smooth breathing, οὐ becomes οὐκ. If the word following begins with a rough breathing, οὐ becomes οὐχ.
μή: Some verbs in other moods or certain types of clauses use μή instead. We will meet μή again in Module 4.




## Principal parts of verbs

All verb forms in these many combinations of person, number, tense, mood and voice, as well as infinitives and participles, are formed using the verb's principal parts.

English verbs have principal parts, too, although native speakers may not learn them as such. In English, the principal parts can include the present, past, and past participle: for example, play, played, played; swim, swam, swum; go, went, gone; do, did, done.

The standard number of principal parts for Ancient Greek verbs is six, although for some verbs fewer principal parts, even only one or two, may exist; and for others, alternatives may exist and increase the total number.

Learning the principal parts of verbs is important so that you will be able to create correct verb forms and so that you will be able to recognize verb forms in a text, both for what person, number, tense, voice, and mood they are and also what verb they come from. In a glossary or a lexicon Greek verbs are listed according to the first principal part, and so if you are looking a verb up you will need to be able to move from a verb form made from any principal part to its first principal part in order to find it in the lexicon.

### Forms of Prinicipal Parts

All principal parts of an Ancient Greek verb are 1st person singular forms.

| Principal part | Form |
| --- | --- |
| 1st	|	1st person singular present active indicative OR 1st person singular present middle indicative if active forms do not exist |
| 2nd	|	1st person singular future active indicative OR 1st person singular future middle indicative if active forms do not exist |
| 3rd	|	1st person singular aorist active indicative OR 1st person singular aorist middle indicative if active forms do not exist |
| 4th	|	1st person singular perfect active indicative |
| 5th	|	1st person singular perfect middle/passive indicative |
| 6th	|	1st person singular aorist passive indicative |

### Verb conjugations

Verbs are organized into "conjugations," a grouping where they share common endings. Ancient Greek has two conjugations: thematic and athematic. The names reflect the presence or the absence of a "thematic vowel" as part of the personal verb endings: thematic verbs use the thematic vowel, while athematic verbs do not. In this module, we will begin practicing forms of both conjugations, and note these differences and the ways they affect the forms. Conjugations are also sometimes named after the common ending of the first prinicpal part, so thematic verbs may be referred to as -ω verbs nd athematic verbs may be called -μι verbs.

### Examples of principal parts

Principal parts are listed in order, 1–6. If a verb does not have a particular principal part, that absence is marked by ---. Note that more than one form may exist for a principal part: those are indicated with "or".

τυγχάνω, τεύξομαι, ἔτυχον, τετύχηκα, ---, --- happen (happen to be, happen upon), obtain, get

### Looking for patterns

As you learn principal parts, you should practice noticing patterns and then using those patterns to help you recognize, retrieve, use, and even take an educated guess at, a principal part. Here are some general patterns to start noticing, but you should work at discovering others that help you memorize, recall, and work with principal parts.

#### Endings

Since all the forms are first-person singular, the ending reflects that person-number. The ending will indicate which conjugation the verb belongs to. In the first principal part, the endings -ω and -ομαι indicate the thematic conjugation, while the endings -μι and -μαι (with some letter other than omicron before it) indicate the athematic conjugation.

For those prinicpal parts that could be either active or middle, the ending will also indicate the voice: -ω or -μι (1st and 2nd principal parts), and -ον or -α (3rd) are active, while -μαι (1st and 2nd) and -μην (3rd) are middle.

For the 4th principal part, which is always active, you can expect the ending -α.
For the 5th, which is always middle/passive, the endings is -μαι.
And the 6th principal part, which is always passive, will end in -ην.

#### Prefixes

For the 3rd and 6th principal parts, which are aorist (a secondary tense) you will see an *augment* prefixed to the verbal stem. The augment is an indication of a secondary tense in the indicative mood (all principal parts are in the indicative mood). The augment may appear as the addition of an ἐ- before a stem that begins with a consonant, or it may appear as the lengthening of the initial vowel if the stem begins with a vowel.

For the 4th and 5th principal parts, which are in the perfect tense, the stem will show reduplication as a sign of the perfect tense. The reduplication may appear as a repetition of the initial consonant of the verb stem. If the initial consonant is aspirated (θ, φ, χ), the reduplication is the corresponding non-aspirated consonant (τ, π, κ, respectively). If the stem starts with multiple consonants, the reduplication will be simply ἐ-. If the stem starts with a vowel, the reduplication will appear as a lengthened vowel.

#### Stem changes

As in English, very common verbs show greater changes to the verb stem in different principal parts. Compare ἔρχομαι (present) and ἦλθον (aorist) with "go" (present) and "went" (past) in English.

Some changes to verb stems appear with many more regular verbs:
A sigma may be added to the present stem for the future and/or aorist active stem (2nd and 3rd principal parts, e.g., κελεύω, κελεύσω, ἐκέλευσα),
A kappa may be part of the stem in the perfect active (4th principal part, e.g., κεκέλευκα).
The 6th principal part may have a theta at the end of its stem, e.g. ἐδυνήθην.




## The aorist indicative

### Verbs

  - we'll always begin to understand our reading by looking for *verbal units* that express an action
  - the form of a verb in ancient Greek expresses the *subject* as well as the *verb*.  Example: the form ἐκέλευσε means "he or she ordered"; the form ἐκέλευσαν means "they ordered."  These are complete sentences that do not need a separate word for "he", "she" or "they."

### The indicative mood and narrating events in the past

As described above, finite verbs have five properties: person, number, tense, mood, and voice.

"Indicative" is a mood, one of the four that ancient Greek has. It is the mode of verb used for narrating factual events. As such, it is a frequently seen mood in most texts.

Ancient Greek has more than one tense for narrating events in the past. The distinction between those past tenses, then, is one of *aspect*—that is, how to think of or picture the action the verb is representing.

  - the *aorist* tense expresses an action as single and simple, without indication of its completion or continuation
  - the *imperfect* tense expresses an action as contiunous, started, ongoing, habitual or in any way incomplete

The choice of tense, then, involves not only an indication that the events happened in the past, but other information about the event. Do you want to emphasize it as a single incident? Choose the aorist indicative if so. Or do you want to indicate that it happened over a length of time, was repeated or habitual, perhaps was started but not completed? The imperfect indicative will give you the means to add those shades of meaning.

### Meaning of aorist indicative and translation into English

The aorist indicate represents the action in a way that can be (and has been) described as "single," "simple," "distinct," the equivalent to a snapshot of the action. The tense that is the closest to this idea in English is the "simple past," the past tense formed in the active voice by adding -ed to the verb stem, or made by changes to the stem, with no other "helping" verbs. Examples of the "simple past" in the active voice: He walked, she ran, they watched. She taught, they learned.

To translate a verb form, you must take into account all five properties: person, number, tense, mood and voice. In the active voice, the subject performs the action. In the passive voice, the subject receives the action. The middle voice is, as the name indicates, in between active and passive, where the subject performs the action in some way for themselves.

To use as examples the verbs of "show" and "command" (compare the sample Greek verbs below), the 3rd person plural aorist indicative in each voice could be translated into English as follows:

  - Active: "they showed," "they commanded"
  - Middle: "they showed (for their own benefit)," "they commanded themselves"
  - Passive: "they were shown," "they were commanded"

### Forming the aorist indicative

To learn this tense + mood, you will need to learn the person and number in all three voices: active, middle, and passive.

As you learn it for any particular verb, you will notice that not all verbs appear in all three voices. For example, the verb γίγνομαι "to become" always and only uses the middle voice.

The aorist tense forms the active and middle voices from the *third* principal part; it forms the passive voice from the *sixth* principal part. So you will need to pay attention to the principal parts for any particular verb to see what forms are possible. For example, if the third principal part appears in the middle, then no active forms are used. If a verb does not have a sixth prinicipal part, then no passive forms are used.

As you look at the third prinicpal part, there are two different patterns of endings. These are referred to as "first" and "second" aorists. The different endings do not have different meanings except in rare cases when both exist for the same verb. That is, both first and second aorists, both sets of endings, represent the single action in the past, and you will accordingly translate each with the English simple past. Compare the two systems of past-tense formation in English: adding "-ed" to the verb stem (which are called "regular" or "weak" verbs) or a change in the verb stem ("irregular" or "strong" verbs): I walked (weak) vs. I went (strong). I consumed (weak) vs. I ate (strong).

You can recognize a verb that has a first aorist by a third principal ending in -α or -άμην. Verbs that have a second aorist have a third principal part that ends in -ον or -όμην. We will return to the second aorist forms later in this module.

#### Aorist active and middle indicative of first aorist verbs

Once you have identified a verb as a first aorist verb, you form other persons and numbers by the following process:

  - (1) the third principal part is in the first singular indicative: start by dropping the first singular ending and the accent from the third principal part:

> ἔδειξα -> ἐδειξ-
> 
> ἐκέλευσα -> ἐκελευσ-

  - (2) Add appropriate ending.  For today, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural.

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  -ε | -ατο |
| 3rd plural | -ᾰν | -αντο |

  - (3) Apply recessive accent.

#### Aorist Passive Indicative

You may see somewhere the reference to "first" and "second" aorists in the aorist passive, but for most purposes, that is a complication we need not be concerned with. All sixth principal parts can be used the same way to form aorist passive forms.

  - (1) Drop the first singular ending -ην and the accent from the sixth principal part

> ἐδείχθην -> ἐδειχθ-
> 
> ἐκελεύθην -> ἐκελευθ-

  - (2) Add appropriate ending

| Person and Number | Ending |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd singular | -η  |
| 3rd plural | -ησαν |

  - (3) Apply recessive accent.

#### Examples

| | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἔδειξε | ἐδείξατο | ἐδείχθη |
| 3rd plural | ἔδειξαν | ἐδείξαντο |ἐδείχθησαν  |

| | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἐκέλευσε | ἐκελεύσατο | ἐκελεύθη |
| 3rd plural | ἐκέλευσαν | ἐκελεύσαντο | ἐκελεύθησαν  |

  - ἀπόλλυμι
  - δυσκολαίνω
  - καθεύδω
  - θηλάζω
  - ὀργίζω. "to anger". Use the middle voice to express "grew angry".
  - ὑποπτεύω




## The imperfect indicative

The imperfect indicative is another way of narrating factual events in the past.
As we have seen, the aorist views an action as a single action completed in the past.
The imperfect, by contrast, expresses an action that is incomplete, repeated, continuous or ongoing, habitual, or in some other way *not* viewed as single and complete. To express similar ideas, English uses additional "helping" verbs: "she was going," "he started to go," "they used to go."

### Forming the imperfect indicative of -ω or thematic verbs

  - all three voices use the *first* principal part, with the addition of an **augment**
  - middle and passive voices have identical forms in this tense

**Augment**:
Past tenses in the indicative mood are indcated by two features: their set of personal endings, and an *augment* at the front of the verb stem.
Compare first and third parts of verbs you already know. The aorist indicative (third prinicipal part) is characterized by adding an epsilon to the first prinicipal part's stem. If the stem begins with a consonant, you will see the epsilon in front of it. If the stem begins with a vowel, you will see that vowel lengthened. Either of these is called an *augment*. The imperfect tense shows the same pattern, but uses the first principal part. So when you need to add an augment, look to the third prinicpal part to see what it should be.

  - (1) start by removing the first person singular ending (-ω or -ομαι) and accent from the first principal part, and add the augment

> γίγνομαι -> ἐγιγν- (Remember that for a verb whose first principal part has a middle ending, you will use only middle endings in the imperfect.
> 
> κελεύω -> ἐκελευ-
> 
> ἔρχομαι -> ἠρχ-
> 
> ἄγω -> ἠγ-

  - (2) Add appropriate ending.  For today, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural.

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle and Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  -ε | -ετο |
| 3rd plural | -ον | -οντο |

  - (3) Apply recessive accent.

Example of κελεύω "command"

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle and Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἐκέλευε  | ἐκελεύετο |
| 3rd plural | ἐκέλευον | ἐκελεύοντο |

The imperfect indicative active could be translated into English as "she/he/it was commanding" or "he/she/it used to command" (3rd singular) or "they were commanding" (3rd plural).

The imperfect indicative middle would add to the active sense that the subject was giving these commands for their own benefit or interests.

The imperfect indicative passive means that the subject is now the one receiving the orders: "he/she it was being commanded" or "they were being commanded."

### Forming the imperfect indicative of -μι or athematic verbs like δείκνυμι

When we practiced aorist forms, the third principal part of the verb δείκνυμι ("to show, demonstrate"), ἔδειξα, indicated that its forms were like that of any first aorist. Since the imperfect is formed from the first principal part, we will notice that δείκνυμι belongs to a different conjugation than our -ω or thematic verbs for forms made from this principal part. The meaning and usage of the imperfect indicative, in all three voices, remains the same, it is simply formed slightly differently.

As with -ω/thematic verbs, for the imperfect indicative of -μι/athematic verbs:

  - all three voices use the *first* principal part, with the addition of an **augment**

  - middle and passive voices have identical forms in this tense
  - (1) start by removing the first person singular ending (-μι or -μαι) and accent from the first principal part, and add the augment

> δείκνυμι  -> ἐδεικνυ-

  - (2) Add appropriate ending.  For today, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural. The key difference in the endings is that they do not include the _thematic_ vowel (hence the name of the conjugation "athematic").

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle and Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  — | -το |
| 3rd plural | -ν | -ντο |

  - (3) Apply recessive accent.

Example of δείκνυμι "show, demonstrate" (note that the upsilon is a long upsilon)

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle and Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἐδείκνυ  | ἐδείκνυτο  |
| 3rd plural | ἐδείκνυν  | ἐδείκνυντο  |

To repoeat, the meaning and usage of these forms is the same. Thus the imperfect indicative active could be translated into English as "she/he/it was showing" or "he/she/it used to show" (3rd singular) or "they were showing" (3rd plural).

The imperfect indicative middle would add to the active sense that the subject was showing for their own benefit or interests.

The imperfect indicative passive means that the subject is now the one receiving the orders: "he/she it was being shown" or "they were being shown."




## Clauses and coordination

  - A verbal unit containing a *finite* verb form is called a *clause*. A sentence consists of one or more clauses.
  - Greek *coordinates* successive clauses with *conjunctions* or *particles*. Ancient Greek has an affinity for connecting clauses and sentences to show their relationship to one another. In many styles of English, starting every sentence by connecting it to the previous one could quickly seem excessive, but doing so is more the norm in many styles of Anicent Greek prose and even poetry.

### Vocabulary for today

These conjunctions *introduce* a clause:

  - ἀλλά.  Strong contrast with previous clause. ("but")
  - καί. Couples following clause with previous clauses. ("and")

These particles are the *second* element of the new clause. One way to describe this placement in their clause is "postpositive" (meaning something like "placed after")

  - γάρ. This clause explains the previous clause.
  - οὖν. This clause draws a conclusion from the prevoius clause.
  - τε.  Couples this clause with the previous clause (similar to καί).
  - μέν ... δέ The use of these particles together show a contrast of some sort along with a connection. A series of two or more clauses can be joined into a *list* using the particles μέν…δέ…<δέ…>; δέ can be repeated to join as many clauses as you like into a single list.




## Contract verbs

The different verbs you have already learned all have stems of the first principal part ending in a *consonant*.  When the first principal part ends in a *vowel*, you use the same endings you have already learned, but they contract with the vowel of the stem. Some verbs that do not have verb stems ending in a vowel in the first principal part do have a vowel at the end of their stem in the *second* principal part, which is used for the future active and middle. We will review these contractions for those forms when we learn the future tense forms.

### Stems ending in -ε-

Vocabulary for today:

  - ἀδικέω
  - δοκέω
  - ποιέω

The first prinicpal part will be listed in a lexicon or glossary with the first prinicipal part ending in ε before the first person ending of -ω.
Recall that our imperfect active and middle/passive indicative personal endings start with vowels, either an ε or an ο:

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle and Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  -ε | -ετο |
| 3rd plural | -ον | -οντο |

The rules of contraction that you will need to learn for these endings (as we learn more endings, we will add others) are as follows:

  - ε + ε = ει
  - ε + ο = ου

The rule of accentuation that you will need for contractions is that if one of the vowels within the sequence would have been accented before the contraction, the contracted syllable, a diphthong, will be accented, and will be accented with a circumflex, if possible under the rules of accentuation for circumflex accents (that it is a long syllable (which the diphthong is), the syllable is the penult or ultima, and if the penult that the ultima is short.

With that additional information, the process of forming the imperfect indicative follows the process already outlined:

  - (1) start by removing the first person singular ending (-ω or -ομαι) and accent from the first principal part, and add the augment

> ἀδικέω -> ἠδικε-
> 
> δοκέω -> ἐδοκε-
> 
> ποιέω -> ἐποιε-

  - (2) Add appropriate ending and contract the vowel at the end of the stem with the vowel at the beginning of the personal ending.

  - (3) Apply recessive accent, keeping in mind the contraction.

**Example**: Imperfect indicative of ἀδικέω

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle and Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἠδίκει | ἠδικεῖτο |
| 3rd plural | ἡδίκουν | ἠδικοῦντο |

To practice, complete the following:

Imperfect indicative of δοκέω:

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle and Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |    |   |
| 3rd plural |  |   |

Imperfect indicative of ποιέω:

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle and Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |    |   |
| 3rd plural |   |   |

### Stems ending in -α-

Vocabulary for today:

  - ὁράω

Verbs whose present stem from the first principal part ends in α operate the same way, but the contractions resulting from the combination of α with the endings are different. The contractions you will need to know for these verbs in the forms we have learned so far are:

  - α + ε = α (long alpha)
  - α + ο = ω

**Example**: Imperfect indicative of ὁράω
(augmented stem: ὡρα-)

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle and Passive ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular | ὥρα  | ὡρᾶται |
| 3rd plural | ὥρων | ὡρῶντο  |




The good news is that you know these already (follows the imperfect). Use βάλλω

## The second aorist

A small group of verbs use a different set of endings to form the active and middle voices of the aorist indicative. We recognize a verb has a "second aorist" set of endings for the aorist active and middle when the third principal part ends in -ον or -όμην.  Examples: ἦλθον (from ἔρχομαι), εἶπον (from λέγω), ἐγενόμην (from γίγνομαι).

#### Active and middle of second aorist  -ω verbs

Formation follows the same process as first aorist active and middle forms.

  - (1) principal parts give an example form in the first singular indicative active of a representative tense: start by dropping the first singular ending -ον or -όμην and the accent from the third principal part:

> ἦλθον -> ἠλθ-
> 
> εἶπον -> εἰπ-
> 
> ἐγενόμην -> ἐγεν-

  - (2) Add appropriate ending.  For today, memorize *third person* endings for singular and plural.

| Person and Number | Active ending | Middle ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  -ε | -ετο |
| 3rd plural | -ον | -οντο |

Notice that these endings are identical to the endings of the imperfect indicative. You will distinguish the imperfect from the aorist for these verbs by noticing which verb stem (which principal part) the ending is applied to. In the imperfect the ending is applied to the first principal part stem, and in the aorist the ending is applied to the third stem. Examples: ἤρχετο "She was going" vs. ἦλθε "She went"; ἔλεγε "She was saying"  - εἶπε "She said."

Note that the 1st person singular active ending in the second aorist -ον is the same as that of the 3rd personal plural active.

  - (3) Apply recessive accent.

#### Examples

| | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  ἦλθε | ἤλθετο | no 6th prinicpal part |
| 3rd plural | ἦλθον | ἤλθοντο | no 6th principal part  |

Note that the first principal part ἔρχομαι shows us that there is no active voice for the forms made from that principal part ("present system"), while ἦλθον shows us that the aorist indicative appears in the active voice using second aorist endings.

| | Active | Middle | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd singular |  εἶπε | εἴπετο | ἐλέχθη |
| 3rd plural | εἶπον | εἴποντο  |ἐλέχθησαν  |

## Ancient Greek in action: the imperfect tense

As you've seen in this module, while the Greek imperfect and aorist tenses can both refer to events in the past, they express different ideas about how an event takes place in time. (This is sometimes called *grammatical aspect*).

# Module 2:  nouns and adjectives




# Module 2: language




## Greek nouns

"Noun" is a part of speech. The ancient Greek word for noun is ὄνομα, which means "name." Nouns name a person, animal, place, or thing (whether that "thing" is concrete or abstract). In a clause or sentence, nouns can fulfill various functions. A noun might be the subject of the verb, the person, place, or thing doing the action the verb represents. A noun might be the object of the the verb, the recipient of the verb's action, or the indirect (or secondary) object of that action. A noun might further describe another noun, or be paired with a preposition to act adjectivally or adverbially. It may decribe the means by which the action of the verb happens. Or it might name the addressee of the sentence. In ancient Greek, the function of the noun is represented by its case, and the case is indicated by the ending attached to the noun's stem. We have already seen that endings provide a great deal of information in a verb form, and the same is true in nouns. Identifying the case of a noun is key to understanding how it is functioning in that particular sentence.

### Overview of nouns

All ancient Greek nouns have gender, case, and number.

  - There are three grammatical **genders**: masculine, feminine, and neuter.
  - **Case** indicates the function of a noun in a sentence. Cases are expressed and identified by endings. There are five cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative.
  - Ancient Greek has three **numbers**: singular, plural, and dual. Dual is used for two nouns considered a pair; we will not see the dual in our readings this year.

#### Dictionary entry of nouns

The dictionary entry of a noun efficiently encodes all the information you need to know in order to produce all of its cases and numbers. The first word tells you its nominative singular form, the second word is its genitive singular form, and the third word, in the form of the definite article, tells you its gender(s).

#### Declension

Nouns are organized into “declensions,” a category of nouns that share the same set of endings. In Greek, there are three declensions of nouns. In this module, we will learn forms of two cases of all three declensions.

#### Accents on nouns

You have learned the rules for accents on verbs, which are *recessive* accents. The same general rules for accents apply to nouns (and adjectives), but nouns carry what we call a *persistent* accent, which means that you must learn where the accent resides as you learn the word. Then, you apply the rules of accentuation as you decline the noun into its full range of cases. There are a number of patterns of persistent accents to practice and learn, which all follow the general rules for accents as you learned in Module 1. In the "language reference" section in this module, you will find demonstrations of these patterns as well as opportunities for practicing them.

### Learning cases: the nominative and genitive cases

The **nominative case** is a naming case; its most frequent function is to indicate the subject of a sentence.

The **genitive case** is used to relate one noun to another/make one noun depend on another. We often translate nouns in the genitive case with the English preposition "of." We will learn more about the functions of the genitive case later in this module.

### Forms of the nominative and genitive cases

#### First declension

Note on the persistent accent: the first declension has one important exception to the expected position of the accent, in the genitive plural. The genitive plural ending of the first declension is always accented with a circumflex. There is a reason for this apparent exception, which has to do with the linguistic development of these forms over time.

Notice below that all the plural endings in this declension are the same, even with the variations in the singular.

For feminine first-declension nouns that end in -η

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -η | -αι |
| Genitive | -ης | -ῶν |

For feminine first-declension nouns that end in -ᾱ

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ᾱ | -αι |
| Genitive | -ᾱς | -ῶν |

For feminine first-declension nouns that end in -ᾰ

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ᾰ | -αι |
| Genitive | -ης | -ῶν |

For masculine first-declension nouns that end in -ης / -ᾱς

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ης / -ᾱς | -αι |
| Genitive | -ου | -ῶν |

#### Second declension

For masculine or feminine second-declension nouns that end in -ος

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ος | -οι |
| Genitive | -ου | -ων |

For neuter second-declension nouns that end in -ον

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ον | -ᾰ |
| Genitive | -ου | -ων |

#### Third declension

The third declension also contains nouns of all three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. The third declension is sometimes called the "consonant declension" because most nouns in this declension have stems ending in a consonant. Because of linguistic

For masculine or feminine third-declension nouns:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | -ς or no ending | -ες  |
| Genitive | -ος  | -ων |

Note that the genitive singular ending in this declension, -ος, is the same as the masculine or feminine ending of the nominative singular form in the second declension. That shows us that knowing what declension a noun belongs to, as well as what gender it is, is crucial for knowing what form the ending is indicating. Compare also the neuter nominative plural ending in both the second and third declensions, -ᾰ, and one of the feminine nominative singular forms in the first declension, also -ᾰ.

For neuter third-declension nouns:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- |----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative | - | -ᾰ |
| Genitive | -ος | -ων |




## The article and the genitive case of nouns

The article is used so frequently in ancient Greek that it must and will become familiar, with its uses and nuances grasped with practice. Pronouns are also frequently used, and come in different types and uses that we will start, but not cover exhaustively, in this section.

### The article

English has a definite article, "the" and an indefinite article, "a" or "an." Ancient Greek has only one article, and its uses are both straightforward and subtle.

#### Forms of the article

The article modifying a noun agrees with it in gender, case, and number. There is a full paradigm of forms with all three genders in all cases and numbers, and it is important to learn to recognize these forms easily. Pay careful attention to and memorize the spelling, including accents and breathing marks, on these forms. There is no vocative form of the article.

| Case  |    | Singular|    |     | Plural  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|    | Masc | Fem  | Neut | Masc | Fem  | Neut |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Nominative | ὁ | ἡ | τό | οἱ | αἱ | τά |
| Genitive | τοῦ | τῆς | τοῦ | τῶν | τῶν | τῶν |
| Dative | τῷ | τῇ | τῷ | τοῖς | ταῖς | τοῖς |
| Accusative | τόν | τήν | τό | τούς | τάς | τά |

Note that the alpha in the neuter nominative and accusative plural form, τά, is a short alpha, while the alpha in the feminine accusative pliral form, τάς, is a long alpha.

#### Some uses of the article

  - Like the English definite article, the ancient Greek article may modify its noun by making it definite or particle: ἡ οἰκία "the house"
  - If indicated by the context, the article can convey a possessive adjective: ὁ ἀνὴρ ἐκ **τῆς** οἰκίας ἦλθεν, "The man went out of **his** house"
  - Differently from English, however, the article may be used to denote a general class, οἱ ἄνθρωποι "people" or "humans"
  - Also differently from English, the article with a proper name, exs. ὁ Ἐρατοσθένης  "Eratosthenes"; αἱ Ἀθῆναι "Athens" or with abstract nouns, ex. ἡ δημοκρατία "democracy"
  - The article has "noun-making" powers: the article can be used with another part of speech, such as infinitives, participles, adjectives, and even particles, to create nouns or "substantives." We will see in more detail later in this module how it is used this way with adjectives.

### The genitive case

As noted briefly above, the genitive case shows a connection between that noun and another noun. We can start with some broad categories of connection that are represented by the genitive. Notice that different uses may result in using similar words in English translation, such as "of": that coincidence provides ease of tranlsation, but we should nevertheless pay attention to what the relationship is. Translation of the genitive is also not *restricted* to using "of" and considering how English expresses that same relationship between nouns is a good habit to get into as you practice translating.

#### Some general uses of the genitive

  - *Possessive genitive*: the genitive case represents the possessor of the other noun. As such, it can be translated into English with the preposition "of" or with the possessive marker "'s". Example: ἡ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς οἰκία "the house of the man" or "the man's house." Possessive genitives are usually placed in attributive position.
  - *Partitive genitive* or *Genitive of the whole*: the genitive expresses a group or a "whole" and the noun it is modifying is part of or one among that group. Example: ἡ βελτίστη γυνὴ πασῶν "the best wife of all." The partitive genitive is generally in the predicate position.
  - *Subjective genitive* or *objective genitive*: when a noun is related to a verb, the genitive can express either the subject or the object of that verbal idea. Understanding the difference between them, even if the same phrasing is used to express each, allows for greater clarity. For example, in the English phrase "the fear of the Athenians," are the Athenians the ones fearing (subjective genitive) or the ones bring feared by someone else (objective genitive)? You would have to tell from context, and you can see that it does make a difference in meaning.
    
      + Subjective genitives, when the genitive is the "doer" of the implied action of the other noun, is usually in attributive position. Example: ἡ τοῦ παιδίου βοά "the cry of the baby" or "the baby's cry"
      + Objective genitives, when the genitive represents the object of the implied action, is usually in the predicate position. Example: πάνιων τῶν κακῶν ἡ αἰτία "the cause of all my problems"

Other uses of the genitive we will meet later in this module, when the genitive is used with prepositions:

  - *Motion away* or *separation*
  - *Agent*

More uses will be introduced and discussed in future modules.




## Direct and indirect objects

Two functions that nouns can have in a clause is to act as the direct object of the verb, or as the indirect object of the verb. In order for a verb to take an object, it must be what we call a *transitive* verb, a verb that expresses an action that acts upon a recipient. The recipient of the action is called the *direct object*. Some verbs may express actions that also involve a secondary recipient: that is the *indirect object*.

In ancient Greek, the **accusative** case is the most common way of expressing a *direct object*. The **dative** case is the most common way of expressing the *indirect object*.

### Direct Object: function of the accusative case

### Indirect Object: function of the dative case




## Pronouns

Pronouns are a part of speech, words that are used in place of and in reference to a noun. There are several types of pronouns in ancient Greek, as there are in English: personal, relative, demonstrative, interrogative, indefinite, reflexive, reciprocal, intensive, and more. We know and use all of these types of pronouns without perhaps knowing their classification. In this section, we will learn the ancient Greek personal pronouns, the relative pronoun, and demonstrative pronouns.




## Noun-adjective agreement

In ancient Greek, an adjective modifying a noun must agree with, or match, that noun in gender, case, and number. Adjectives from any of the three declensions can modify nouns from any of the three declensions. That is, the adjective need not "match" the noun in declension and its particular case endings, although sometimes by coincidence, the endings will look the same, especially if the adjective and noun come from the same declension.

Examples of noun-adjective agreement from Lysias I.6-10

τὸν ἄλλον χρόνον masculine accusative singular

τῷ πρώτῳ χρόνῳ masculine dative singular

πολὺν χρόνον masculine accusative singular

οἰκειότητα μεγίστην feminine accusative singular

οἰκονόμος δεινή feminine nominative singular

ἡ ἐμὴ γυνή feminine nominative singular (but note that γυνή is a 3rd declension noun, and the genitive case would be τῆς ἐμῆς γυναικός)

γυναῖκα σωφρονεστάτην feminine accusative singular

πάντων τῶν κακῶν neuter genitive plural

οἰκίδιον διπλοῦν neuter nominative singular

Because of the lack in English of gender and case with nouns and lack of even number with adjectives, English does not have explicit rules about noun-adjective agreement (as it does for subject-verb agreement, for example). The adjective does not change between one green shoe and two green shoes, an old woman or a group of old men.

But note that English has interesting “ingrained” rules about the order of adjectives when there is more than one. Most native speakers of English know these rules as just what “sounds right” or “sounds wrong,”  “Old green shoes” obeys these rules while “green old shoes” does not.
https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160908-the-language-rules-we-know-but-dont-know-we-know

English language learners are sometimes asked to learn these rules explicitly. That is a good reminder of the way in which language rules are defined for non-native-speakers (as we all are for ancient Greek) in a way that complicates the sense of a language meant to communicate.

### Adjective placement: attributive and predicate positions

Adjectives can describe a noun, and thus in ancient Greek must agree with that noun in gender, case, and number, from different syntatical positions in a sentence.

One of those positions is called the **attributive** position, when the adjective qualifies the noun within a noun phrase. The other is called the **predicate** position, when the adjective is part of the predicate of the clause or sentence. Compare these exmaples in English:

_The tall woman went to the market._ The adjective "tall" is in the attributive position.

_The woman is tall._ The adjective "tall" is in the predicate position, syntactically connected to the verb of the sentence.

In both sentences, the adjective "tall" describes the woman, and so in ancient Greek would be the same gender, case, and number as the noun "woman": since "woman" is the subject of each sentence, the adjective will be feminine, nominative, singular, as the noun is.

**Attributive** position in ancient Greek follows the article that modifies the noun. The article can be repeated to create this position:
ἡ μεγάλη γυνή  'the tall woman'
ἡ γυνὴ ἡ μεγάλη  'the tall woman'

Note that the article may be absent, and if so, the word order of adjective and noun is less restricted, such as οἰκονόμος δεινή above.

**Predicate** position is a placement outside of the article + noun phrase.

ἡ μεγάλη γυνὴ εἰς τὴν ἀγορὰν ἦλθον. OR ἡ γυνὴ ἡ μεγάλη εἰς τὴν ἀγορὰν ἦλθον. _The tall woman went to the market._ (attributive position)

ἡ γυνὴ μεγάλη ἐστίν. _The woman is tall._ (predicate position)

### Adjectives used as nouns, substantive adjectives

Adjectives, and indeed any kind of modifier, can be used with the definite article to function as nouns. A term for this use is "substantive adjectives." English does this, too. In a sentence such as "Only the good die young," we understand "the good" to refer to "good persons," a group that is abstract in nature. In the sentence "That's all for the good," we understand "the good" to refer to an abstract quality.

Ancient Greek tends to use substantive adjectives much more often than English does, though, and takes advantage of the gender and number of adjectives to express a wider variety of the understood noun. Because ancient Greek has that flexibility, to understand and translate it properly, you must supply a noun that reflects that gender and number:

ὁ ἀγαθός, masculine singular, "the good man"; οἱ ἀγαθοί masculine plural "good men," "the good men" or "the good" (ancient Greek defaults to the masculine when describing a group of persons of mixed gender, whether possible or actual)

ἡ ἀγαθή feminine singular, "the good woman"; αἱ ἀγαθαί feminine plural "the good women," "good women"

τὸ ἀγαθόν neuter singular, "the good thing" or "the good" as a abstract quality; τὰ ἀγαθά "good things," "the good things," "goods" or "the good". Neuter plaural substantives are especially flexible in meaning and thus can be used in a variety of contexts.




## Prepositions

A *preposition* is a part of speech, like noun or verb or adjective, in both English and ancient Greek. Its ancient Greek name is πρόθεσις. It is used to create a relationship between a noun and another word. A preposition and a noun create a *prepositional phrase*. That prepositional phrase may act adjectivally to modify a noun or adverbially to modify a predicate. Compare the uses of the prepositional phrase "on the beach" in these two English sentences:

> The women on the beach were playing. (describes which women, adjectival)

> The women were playing on the beach. (describes where they were playing, adverbial)

The nouns in a prepositional phrase in ancient Greek will be one of the oblique cases: genitive, dative, and accusative. We have already learned that noun cases in Greek have particular functions. These functions broadly determine which of the cases will be the object of a particular preposition. For example, the genitive conveys motion away from, the dative is used for a stationary position, and the accusative for motion toward or into. That relationship of case and function is apparent also with some prepositions that take more than one case of noun: which case is used shades the meaning of the preposition, sometimes subtly, sometimes substantially.

Therefore, it is important as you learn prepositions as vocabulary that you also learn which case(s) of noun each takes as its object, and how the case of the object affects the meaning of the preposition. Preposition usage in English is highly idiomatic, and so the practice of translation requires, as always, a good understanding of what the Greek is expressing and how English expresses that same idea, rather than a single equivalence of word to word.

#### Frequently used prepositions that take only one case

| Preposition | case of noun object | English near-equivalents
| --- | --- | --- |
ἀπό | + genitive | away from, from
εἰς | + accusative | into, to, toward, in regard to
ἐκ, ἐξ | + genitive | out of, from
ἐν | + dative | in, on, among, within
σύν | + dative | with

#### Frequently used prepositions that take more than one case

| Preposition | case of noun object | English near-equivalents |
|---|---|--- |
ἐπί | + genitive | near, at, upon
ἐπί |  + dative   | at, on, upon, in addition to
ἐπί |  + accusative | to, onto, up to, toward; against
κατά  | + genitive | down from, against
κατά | + accusative | down to, down along, in accordance with
μετά | + genitive | among, with
μετά | + accusative | after
παρά | + genitive | from the side of
παρά |  + dative   | at the side of, next to, beside
παρά | + accusative | to the side of, beside, beyond, contrary to
περί | + genitive | around, about
περί |  + dative   | around, about
περί | + accusative | around, concerning
πρός | + genitive | from
πρός |  + dative   | near, beside; in addition to
πρός | + accusative | to, toward, against; regarding
ὑπό | + genitive | from under; by {personal agent, see below)
ὑπό |  + dative   | under (stationary), at the hands of
ὑπό | + accusative | under (motion toward)

### Compound Verbs

The adverbial properties of prepositions can also be seen in so-called compound verbs, in which a preposition is a prefix on a verb and shades its meaning according. For example, ἔρχομαι 'to go' --> εἰσέρχομαι 'to go into, enter'

### Agent: a use of the preposition ὑπό + genitive

We have seen that the subject of a passive verb is the recipient of the action expressed by that verb: for example, "you are caught." To express who is the agent of the action of the passive verb, English uses the preposition "by": "you are caught by her husband." Ancient Greek expresses the personal agent of a passive verb with the preposition ὑπό plus a noun in the genitive. You can remember the three "P's" of personal agent: passive verb, preposition, and person in the genitive.

# Module 4: Subordination, the Subjunctive and Optative Moods

In this module, we will introduce the first of several types of subordinate clauses you will learn in Greek: the purpose clause.

You will see that the purpose clause (a subordinate clause, introduced by a subordinating conjunction with a verb in the subjunctive or optative) is an alternative method of expressing the idea of purpose through a future tense participle. Options!

This subordinate clause features finite verbs of the subjunctive or optative mood.




## The Subjunctive and Optative Moods: Overview

You were introduced to the indicative mood in Module 1. In this module, you will learn how to form verbs in the subjunctive and optative moods. Verbs in these moods appear frequently in subordinate clauses (such as the purpose clause, in this module) and in certain independent clauses (which you will learn about next semester).

Learning to form subjunctive and optative verbs will open up whole worlds of expression — possibilities, conditions, wishes, mental content of all sorts.

### Important things to know:

  - The way we translate subjunctives and optatives is entirely dependent on their context. You must always first identify the type of "verbal chunk" they belong to. The "tense" of a verb in these moods represents the *aspect* of the action, not the *time*. Thus a present subjunctive or optative expresses ongoing or continuous action, and an aorist subjunctive or optative expresses a single action.
  - Forming these verbs requires only adding a new set of endings onto the same principal part stems that you have already learned.

### Forming the present subjunctive and optative

**Present subjunctive**

To the stem from the first principal part, add the following endings:

| Number | Active | Middle/Passive |
|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -ῃ  | -ηται  |
| 3rd plural  | -ωσι(ν)  | -ωνται |

**Present optative**

| Number  | Active  | Middle/Passive  |
|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -οι   | -οιτο   |
| 3rd plural  | -οιεν   | -οιντο   |

### Forming the aorist subjunctive and optative

As you would expect, for the active and middle, add endings to the stem from the third principal part. For the passive, add endings to the stem from the sixth principal part. Subjunctive and optative forms never carry an augment, however, so you must remove the augment from the stem.

Examples:

**Aorist subjunctive**

|   | Active  | Middle  | Passive  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -ῃ   | -ηται  | -ῇ  |
|  3rd plural | -ωσι(ν)| -ωνται | -ῶσι(ν)  |

**1st Aorist optative**

|   | Active  | Middle  | Passive  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -αι or -ειε(ν)  | -αιτο   | -είη  |
|  3rd plural | -αιεν or -ειαν   | -αιντο   | -είησαν or -εῖεν  |

**2nd Aorist optative**

|   | Active  | Middle  | Passive  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3rd singular  | -οι   | -οιτο   | -είη   |
|  3rd plural | -οιεν  | -οιντο   | -είησαν or -εῖεν  |




## Purpose clauses

A purpose clause is a subordinate clause. "Clause" means it has its own subject and verb, while "subordinate" means that it is dependent on the main clause of the sentence and does not stand alone. As the name indicates, purpose clauses explain the reason(s) behind the main action: why, or for what purpose, the action of the main clause was done. The verb of a purpose clause is never in the indicative mood.

Identify the purpose expressed in these English sentences:
He told them everything so that they would understand.
So that she wouldn't have to climb stairs, she slept on the first floor.
The students practiced their Greek forms daily to learn them better.
We live in order to love.

The structure of a purpose clause in ancient Greek has the following featurs

  - it is introduced by a specific subordinating conjunctions, ἵνα, ὡς, or ὅπως
  - if the verb in the purpose clause is negated, it is negated by μή
  - the verb within the purpose clause will be in the subjunctive or the optative mood, according to the **sequence of moods**.




## Sequence of Moods: Overview

The term "Sequence of Moods" describes the relationship between the tense/mood of a sentence's main verb and the mood of the verb in a subordinate clause.

The sequence is called either "Primary" or "Secondary." Primary tenses of verbs are those that express action in the present or future, while secondary tenses are those that express action in the past. The subjunctive mood is associated with the primary tenses. The optative mood is associated with the secondary tenses.

| Sequence | Tense of the main verb | Mood of the verb in subordinate clause |
| --- | --- | ---|
| Primary | Present, Future, or Perfect | Subjunctive |
| Secondary | Imperfect, Aorist, or Pluperfect | Optative |

## Module 4: translation assignment

We return to the unusual physical arrangement of Euphiletos' household. He explains in court why these arrangements came to be:

> ἵνα δὲ μή κινδυνεύῃ κατὰ τῆς κλίμακος καταβαίνουσα, ἐγὼ μὲν ἄνω διῃτώμην, αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες κάτω. καὶ οὕτως ἤδη συνειθισμένον ἦν, ὥστε πολλάκις ἡ γυνὴ ἀπῄει κάτω καθευδήσουσα ὡς τὸ παιδίον, ἵνα τὸν τιτθὸν αὐτῷ διδῷ καὶ μὴ βοᾷ.

Later, when Euphiletos is at dinner and Eratosthenes is in the home, the baby begins to cry.

> καὶ ἐγὼ τὴν γυναῖκα ἀπιέναι ἐκέλευον καὶ δοῦναι τῷ παιδίῳ τὸν τὴν γυναῖκα ἀπιέναι ἐκέλευον καὶ δοῦναι τῷ παιδίῳ τὸν τιτθόν, ἵνα παύσηται κλαῖον.
