# Approaching a passage at sight

You are now prepared to apply what you have learned so far in this textbook to any passage of Greek you encounter.  This section summarizes ideas you have already encountered in a detailed guide to help you approach a passage of Greek you have never seen before.  


## A practice of reading

As we have done throughout this textbook, rather than simply reading one word or phrase at a time progressing from left to right, we will begin by finding the larger syntactic structures of a sentence or paragraph.  

> Do *not* write out an English translation as you work through a passage.  If you do, you cannot help but focus on the version in the familiar language, rather than on recognizing the structure of the Greek passage.

In Greek, these larger structures can be grouped into *verbal expressions*: the most important of these are clauses, participial expressions, and indirect statement.


## A hierarchy of verbal expressions


Remember that the only verbal expressions that can appear alone are *main clauses*:  that is,  a clause with a finite verb, normally introduced or continued from previous clauses by a conjunction or connecting particle.  *Subordinate clauses* depend on a main clause (explicitly or implicitly): they also have a finite verb, but are introduced by a subordinating conjunction.  Participial expressions are attached to (and agree in gender, case and number with) a noun in a clause.  Indirect statment is introduced by some other verbal expression (most often a finite verb in a clause), and is constructed with either an infinitive (after a verb expressing *speaking* or *thinking*), or a participle (after a verb expressing *perceiving*), with the subject of the indirect statement in the accusative case.

Every Greek sentence, in other words, contains a *hierarchy* of verbal expressions, with a main clause at its root, and zero or more dependent verbal expressions (which, in turn, may have their own dependent verbal expressions).  To make sense of a sentence you are looking at for the first time, begin by identifying its hierarchy of verbal expressions. (This is why our reading practice regularly formats new passages indented to show their hierarchy of verbal expressions.)


### Main clauses

Begin by breaking a sentence into clauses, one for each finite verb, and determine whether each clause is a main clause, or a secondary clause. Remember that Greek normally includes a conjunction  (such as καί) or connecting particle (such as δέ) to connect a main clause to its context, while a subordinate clause will be introduced by a subordinating conjunction.  Identifying how conjunctions and particles connect clauses will help you understand the logic of the sentence, as well as the syntax of the sentence.


#### The main verb

> Since every sentence has a main clause with a finite verb, find the main verb before you do anything else.

If you are reading a narrative text, the main verb will most frequently be in the indicative mood.  Less frequently, the main verb could, for example, be a command in the imperative mood, a negative command (with μή) in the subjunctive mood, or a wish in the optative mood. It could also be part of a condition, such as a future less vivid condition with the main verb in the optative mood.  If a particle such as ἄν or εἴθε appears with the main verb, note this.

#### Complements to the verb

When you have found the main  verb, work out what other parts of the clause depend on it.


- Does your verb take an object?  Make sure you know how the verb and object are constructed (e.g., ἀκούω is constructed with a genitive for the source, or person, you hear from, but an accusative for the thing you hear).  Note any direct or indirect objects of the main verb.
- Is it a verb that requires a complementary infinitive (e.g., ἐθέλω or βούλομαι)?  If so, find the infinitive that goes with it.
- Is it a verb like φαίνομαι or τυγχάνω that can be used with a supplementary participle? If so, check for the participle.
- Does your verb introduce indirect statement?  If so, identify whether your verb expresses speaking or thinking, and uses an accusative subject with an infinitive for indirect statement; or does it express perceiving or thinking, and an accusative subject with a  participle for indirect statement?






### Subordinate clauses

Once you have isolated a main clause and worked out how other parts of the sentence depend on the main verb, turn to dependent clauses, and answer these two questions:

- What conjunction introduces the clause?
- What is the verb of the clause, and what is its tense and mood?

This should let you identify the kind of clause (e.g., purpose, protasis of a condition...)

You can then work out any [complements to the verb](#complements) of the dependent clause, as you did for
 the main clause.


### Attributive participles

After you have worked out the principal clause, and any secondary clauses, check for participles in attributive position. You can recognize these easily, because, in addition to agreeing in gender, case and number with the noun they modify, they will be tightly linked to the noun by the definite article.

> Attributive participles *identify* the noun they describe, similar to how English uses *relative clauses* to identify a noun.


### Circumstantial participles

After you have found any participles used as supplementary participles with verbs like φαίνομαι, and any attributive participles, you can analyze the remaining, circumstantial participles. The rich and flexible use of participles is a distinctive feature of Greek that has no single counterpart in English. You should not think of a circumstantial pariticiple as the equivalent of an English participle. Instead, Greek participles express a range of ideas that might be represented in English by a wide variety of subordinate clauses.

Like any adjective, the participle will take not only its gender and number, but also its case from the noun it agrees with. When the participle agrees with a noun that has no syntactic relation to the rest of the syntax, they are normally in the genitive case (the “absolute” usage of the noun, the genitive absolute).

As with any other verbal expression, you should look for any [complements](#complements) (such as objects) that depend on the participle.



The following table summaries the main possibilities  you should consider in interpreting a circumstantial participle.



| Sense of	participle |Tense of participle or other syntax | Translation hint |
|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Temporal | In general, aorist expresses that participial action occurred before primary verb;  present tense expresses that participial action is simultaneous with primary verb. | “After ...” (aorist) or “While...” (present) |
| Causal | | “Because...” |
| Manner | | “By ...” (doing something) |
|  Descriptive | | May sometimes correspond to an English participle (e.g., “doing ...”) |
| Concessive | |“Although ...”  |
| Purpose | Ὡς  + future participle |  “In order to ...” |
| View point of subject |Ὡς  + participle (not in future tense) | “On the grounds that...” |
| Conditional | Equivalent to protasis of a condition; note that negative will therefore be μή. | “If ...”  (translation will depend  on type of condition) |


## Rereading

At this stage, you have analyzed the entire sentence, and can now reread the sentence with a full understanding of its syntax. As you reread a passage repeatedly, you will find that on successive rereadings you may quickly or even automatically begin to recognize the sentence's structure. When you feel confident that you have made sentence of the sentence, try to reread it without notes or other help.

Better yet, reread the whole paragraph the sentence occurs in (or extend this idea to reread the entire text you are studying...)
