### English participles
While English also has adjectives derived from verbs that we call "participles," the Greek participle is used quite differently.  It will be more helpful think of the participle that, like the clause, always has a subject and verbal action.  



English has a very limited set of participles.  We can add *ing* to a verb stem to create a participle in a present tense and active voice.  In a phrase like the cliché "babbling brook "brook" is a noun described by the adjective "babbling". "Babbling" is a participle in the active voice: we're saying that "the brook babbles."  It's also in the present tense: the brook is babbling as we speak.

We can also add *ed* to a verb stem to create a participle in a past tense and passive voice.  The phrase "dreaded news" describes the noun "news" with an adjective made from the verb "to dread".  The voice is passive: the news is not the active subject dreading something, but the passive subject, the thing that is dreaded.  The tense is past: the news was already dreaded before we speak.
